# DIY MEDIA TOOLKIT

It's like this: The gear needed to make high quality, professional media yourself has never been more affordable or accessible. If you want to report the news, make a film, record an album, or create a podcast, the tools required are available for less than you might suspect.

Here we're running down a quick list of our top suggestions for affordable and useful hardware and software for media creators, along with some tips on how to use each item. This is not meant to represent the top of the line, but rather to serve as a reference for good, cheap, and occasionally creative solutions.

Remember, it's DIY media! No one expects it to look or sound like a hollywood block buster, you just have to get your ideas across, and this is a list of tools to help you do that, at various price levels. 

*Note: while we usually recommend (and use!) Free and Open Source software wherever possible, Media Production often benefits from the use of proprietary software. Making new things, as quickly and simply as possible is our primary goal, and we will use (and recommend) software that we disagree with ideologically when they are the best options for meeting larger goals.*

## Audio (podcasts + music)

A big part of many media projects is audio production. From Podcasts, to music, to sound enineering for video, many media projects realy heavily on the creation, capture, and manipulation of audio. Here, we're going through various peices of hardware and software for capturing and manuplating sound. In the future, we'll likely create a more in depth guide to making music on the cheap.  

### Hardware

**Cheap Lavalier Microphones**
  - Clip on to your shirt, plug in to the mic in on your phone, PC, or portable recording device.
  - Small and cheap (often less than $12) 
  - Sound quality is good enough, and it's a great way to get started. 


**USB Mic**

USB Microphones are exactly what it says on the tin. These are mics with integrated audio interfaces, perfect for capturing high quality audio from voices for conversations, or other single audio sources. 

Pros: Cheaper to get started than an interface or dedicated recording device, more portable, can be made to work with iOS and Android, Great for Podcasting 

Cons: Less versitile than other options, Only works with computers and smartphones, not good for music (unless you're just doing vox/guitar) 

- Whatever headset you use for video calls 
- Shure MV5 Digital Condenser Microphone + USB & Lightning Cable
  - Small, lightweight, and portable 
  - Has Lightning cable support for iOS
- Blue Snowball USB Microphone
  - Less portable
  - Much cheaper (as cheap as $40 on a regular basis) 
  - It is a condensor mic means it will pick up quiet sounds, and make them louder. This isn't always a good thing, but sometimes it is. 

**Portable Audio Recorders**

Portable audio recorders are the best way to record audio when you're away from a computer. For example, when you're in the field, shooting video. They make an excellent source for off-camera audio when doing video production, or a capture device for podcasts, or even live music performances. 

Pros: Reasonably priced, portable, high quality, the H4 can accept XLR input for use with better mic.

Cons: Requires extra step to move audio from device to computer.

  - Great for field audio
  - Could serve as a good source for off-camera sound for video projects
  - Could work for capturing audio for podcasts, or live concert performances
- Zoom H4 Digital Recorder
  - Same as above, but higher quality 
  - Built in XLR inputs means you can connect even Higher Quality mics, and get real studio quality output.
  - Four track recording! Push the audio from each input to it's own track for later mixing. 

### Software

Capturing and editing audio is a complicated task, and the gold standards for software are pretty damn expensive. Here are some cheap/free alternatives for Windows and Mac. (propritary/closed source apps are marked with an asterisk)  

- audacity
- garage band *
- lmms  
- ardour 

I'm sure lots of people have opinions or suggestions for other software here. If you're among them, that's fine. If you're not, just stick to audacity unless you have a reason to do otherwise. It's free, it works well enough, and it's easy enough to use. Save often. 

## Video (films/tv shows/vlogs)

Professional quality video production used to require tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. Now, even devices as common as the iPhone can shoot video in a quality that was possible at the consumer level 15 or 20 years ago. When dealing with dedicated video cameras, even some of those at the low end, can deliver results that would have costs thousands of dollars, even as recently as 10 years ago. 

### Hardware 

The trick here is finding a camera with image stablization, optical zoom, and the biggest sensor (or group of sensors) you can manage. On the low end, expect to spend $200 or so, or around $800 for 4k (cinema resolution)

- Canon VIXIA HF R[6|7|8]00
	- Thess model are functionally identical to the VIXIA HF R700, but one can occasionally be found for cheaper than the other
    - Solid HD camera, better than anything in the $200 price range has been historically. Not actually professional quality, but good enough for most uses.  
    - It's $200
    - 
- Various Sony 4K HD Video Recording Camcorders
	- Captures 4k (That is, twice as big as than "full" HD; currently, 4k is the most common digital cinema resolution)  
    - Larger image sensor 
    - 20x Optical zoom 
    - High Quality Image Stablization 
    - Expensive at nearly $600 - $1000 (but so much cheaper than the $5k plus these were a few years ago!)
- Canon HF G20 
    - This camera and the other cameras in the G line are high end/prosumer HD camcorders 
    - They are expensive, often more than $1000, but can be found for reasonable prices on the used market occasionally. 
    - This is what I use personally. 
- Cellphones 
	- The iPhone produces surprisingly good video, and it'll do in a pinch. Most newer Android phones too! 
    - Apple's iMovie for iOS is less feature rich than the MacOS version, but it does enable quick editing directly from your capture device, and syncs with desktop iMovie reasonably well 
    - The finished product probably won't look like professionally shot footage, *but that's far less important than having quality content* (a lesson Hollywood could stand to learn) 
    - If you don't already have one, there are other problems with the iOS landscape that prevent me from recommending the iPhone, on principal, but if you already have one, you might as well make use of it. 
    - If you can, consider gettin a cellphone gimbal for hand held recording. This works like a steadycam, ensuring steady video and smooth panning. 
    - 


### Software 

Most video editing software is an unfortunately complicated/difficult/expensive, but there is hope! If you have a mac, iMovie is a surpsingly competent video editor. For Windows, Windows Movie Maker doesn't completely suck (but it's not great.)  

- iMovie *
- Windows Movie Maker *
- Open Shot 
- Shotcut 
- Adobe Premiere ($20/month) *

Hop on your video sharing site of choice, and look for tutorials. Watching a few tutorials will save you a lot of effort in the long run. 


## Photography 

Honestly, the old addage is true. The best camera is the one you have with you. If you have an iPhone, or a reasonably recent Android phone, it probably has a good enough camera on it for 75 - 80 % of what you need. For those occasions when a Phone Camera doesn't cut it, here are some suggestions for alternatives.

### Good and Cheap
These are standard issue digital cameras that take photos that are better than most cell phones (though, to be fair, the iPhone comes reasonably close.) Areas where these cameras tend to shine over cellphones include optical zoom, low light performance, and resolution. They are also capable when it comes to video, but they are limited to shorter clips, and worse audio, than video cameras in the same price range.  

The Coolpix line 
The Powershot line


### High Optical Zoom

There are a few benefits to getting one of these cameras, with an integrated optical zoom. First, they take much larger pictures than most smartphones, with better colors, sharper details. Second, 20x optical zoom is nothing to laugh at. If deployed correctly, that optical zoom can make a world of difference to an image. 

The third benefit to this style of camera is a little more dubious: The Appearence of Professionalism. These cameras tend to look close enough to higher end cameras that the casual observer can't tell the difference. It's easier to bluff your way in to the press pool with something that looks like a pro would use it.

These cameras are practically identical, and they generally feature: 

- ~36 x optical zoom
- reasonable low-light
- Worse than the above cameras for general use, but significantly better for distant subjects

The Panasonic Lumix FZ80 is an example of this kind of camera, as is the Sony DSCH300. 

The market changes often, so options may be different when you're reading this. The words "super zoom", "high zoom", and "astro zoom" get tossed around to describe these cameras. You'll probably end up spending between $150 and $300 on a camera like this. 

These cameras and the above photography cameras will serve as passable video cameras in a pinch. Use what you have. Don't worry about being perfect. Most still cameras are limited to 15 - 30 minutes of video recording because of an EU tarrif that is ridiculous, so plan for that. 
	

### Good Low Light

Low light performance is super important in a lot of situations, but most cameras are at their worst in low light situations. Unfortunately, cameras that consistently provide high quality low-light performance tend to cost lots of money. This is one trick you might try for better low light performance. 

Infrared Camera + an infrared flashlight

Infrared light is invisible to the naked eye, so you can use an IR camera and an IR flashlight to capture details in complete darkness. Unfortunately, IR Cameras are hard to find outside of those designed for hunting applications. The PiNoir module for the raspberry pi may be the most easily obtained, but it is largely available in kit form. 

If we come across a better IR solution, we'll update the guide. 

### Professional Quality

DSLRs and Micro 4/3 cameras tend to be expensive and complicated. If you're a pro photographer, go for it! If not, this may be more trouble (or expense) than its worth. That being said, here are some pointers: 

**Using Vintage Glass**

Pentax's current line of SLRs and 4/3s cameras can use every K-Mount lens they released, since the introduction of the K-Mount system back in the 60s. These lenses are available everywhere, and they're generally cheap as heck (as long as you don't mind manual lenses.) 

Adapters exist for using most vintage lenses with most modern mounting systems, but you'll have to pay attention to the crop factor (which will change the focal length of the lens.) 

**Best Models**

This is complicated. New cameras are released all the time, and they are hard to tell apart. Get the biggest sensor you can afford, with the lens mounting system that you're most comfortable with. Expect to spend a minimum of $500, but prices can go much higher. 

**Special Considerations** 

SLRs and 4/3s cameras can take great video, but normally only in short bursts. Having a camera body and detachable lenses means you have a lot of expensive, and fragile gear to cart around. Unless you know what you're doing, you aren't likely to get significantly better shots with a professional camera than you would with a point and shoot. If you do know what you're doing, the manual controls are invaluable, and will often produce stunning results. 

If you want to learn what you're doing, maybe consider learning with a vintage film camera? Or not, that's getting harder all the time. 


### Film

There is still something to be said for Analog Photography. While we don't recommend making a film camera the only camera you take on a shoot, knowing your way around an old school SLR, point-and-shoot, or even Polaroid is a valuable skill, and the results from an Analog Camera can lend an authenticity to a project that is otherwise very difficult to capture. 

**Picking a vintage SLR**

The trick here is finding a functional body that uses easy to find lenses, and takes a commonly available battery. The Pentax K1000 normally fits this bill. They're cheap, they are full manual, they use commonly available glass, and they are practically indestructable. Do not spend a lot of money on a K1000, they were among the most common SLRs of the film era, and they were produced for *years*. Expect to pay less than $100. 

They were never top of the line cameras. They were always middle of the road cameras from a middle of the road manufacturer, but they tick all the important boxes in terms of features and availability. Find a good film photography tutorial, use Zinc-Air hearing aid batteries for the light meter, or use an outboard lightmeter and full manual shooting. With a little luck, you'll get some great pictures. 

I'm also a fan of Minoltas (which normally use a more common battery), but I've had a hard time finding Minolta lenses and bodies on the used market. YMMV. 

**Instant Film**

Instant Cameras (polaroids) were all the rage for a while. They can add a fun dimension to a media project. There are two ways to approach instant film today, and once you commit to one, your stuck with it. 

Option one is the Fujifilm Instax line. New Instax Wide cameras run about $100, and film can be found for between $1 and $2 per print. These are about the same size as old polaroids, but shaped differently, so they lack a little bit of the imediate reaction that the poloroid tends to generate. On the other hand, the cameras are widely available, and the film is about half as expensive. 

The other option for instant photography is to find a new or vintage polaroid that is [Impossible compatible](https://us.impossible-project.com/). Impossible film tends to run about $3/shot, but has the benefit of the classic polaroid look. Apparently new Poloroid cameras are available off the shelf at various big box retailers in the US. 

Once you've shot a picture on an instant camera, remove it from the camera and put it somewhere out of the light for half an hour so it can develop. Keep prints out of the sun in general, as they'll fade.  

**Getting film developed**

If you don't have a quality idependent film lab nearby, you have two options for getting film developed. 

- Option One: Photo Centers
	- Many businesses still operate photolabs. If your local Walmart or Target still has a photo lab, you can usually drop your film off there. Generally, they'll mail it off for central proccessing. Walgreens will still develop in house. Most modern photo labs offer a CD only option that is only a few dollars. 
    - Unless you don't have another option, it's usually a good idea to find an independent photo lab near you. They'll do a better job, and be more careful with your photos. 
- Option two: DIY 
	- If you're developing your film in black and white, and you don't mind dealing with some chemicals, going the DIY route has been the chosen option for as long as photo-journalism has been a field. 
    - Don't try to go the DIY route for color photography. It's messy and barely works. 
    - There are a handful of how-to guides out there, but basically you'll need: 
    	- Developer 
        	- bathe the film in this to start the development proccess. 
        - Fixer
        	- This stops the development proccess when it is finished, so you don't end up with blank images 
        - Some tubs to do it all 

Let me be clear here, the DIY option is not the best or easiest way, but it is the cheapest in the long run, and it's likely that it will remain a viable option long after commercial film development becomes essentially inaccessable. 



*Why Bother?* 

Most of the time, when I mention using traditional film photography, I'm met with blank stares. There are a few reasons to take pictures this way: It's still often the cheapest way to get high quality/professional photographs, especially in low-light conditions; Digital cameras don't do a good job of emulating the look of film; it's fun; It is a tangible (analog) connection to our history. 

That being said, don't miss an image in the name of an aesthetic. Film is fragile, and finicky. Results from a developer are often unpredictable. As fun as film can be, and as Magical as the results often are, we have ditial cameras now, and they have fewer of these problems. 

## Text

Creating, managing, and colaborating on documents is a central function of most media projects. This should be simple, but it often isn't. So let's talk about how we can make it more simple: 

**Collaborating**

There are a few ways to collaborate on a text based project. Each has it's own hurdles, as discussed below 

- git
	- git (and github and gitlab and all the rest) serve as a great platform for version control and collaborative writing. 
	- Open Source, distributed 
    - Can be kind of confusing for folks that don't already use it. 
- google docs
	- Google Docs works well for real time collaboration 
	- provides rudimentary version control 
	- It's convenient, and generally intuitive (as long as you don't mind that Big Brother is watching.) 
- dropbox
	- Work in whatever program you want, and sync files with dropbox 
	- Great for collaborating on all kinds of files, not just text 
	- No version control 
	- The NSA is probably watching, since [Condoleezza Rice is on their board of directors](http://boingboing.net/2014/04/09/condoleeza-rice-supporter-of.html) 
- Nextcloud 
	- An open source dropbox style software
    - Host it on your own servers, use it like dropbox, or use it with the various web interaces. 
    - It's actually really neat, just make sure you're doing regular backups. 
- sneakernet 
	- Trading files on physical media is the old school way to collaborate 
	- It's not the fastest or easiest method, but it's probably the most secure

Other software works too! There's lots of file syncronization software. Heck, even e-mail works pretty well.
