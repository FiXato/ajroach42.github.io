title: "Shada - Douglas Adams' Unfinished Doctor Who Arc - reborn in countless works of fan fiction"
---

In the 80s, Douglas Adams was show runner for Doctor Who (the role most recently held by Stephen Moffet, and previously by Russel T. Davies.) This meant that he wrote bits of just about every episode for the length of his run **TK**, and that he was generally in charge of making sure things went smoothly. Predictably, things did not go smoothly at all. 

The 80s were a tumoltious time for the BBC, and Adams' Who contributed to that a fair amount. One of the most infamous stories to come out of this era regards the unfinished episode Shada (which went on to [become the basis for Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency](http://ajroach42.github.io/the-outer-edge-of-fanfic/).) There were a lot of problems surroudning the production of this episode, including the fact that the script was litterally being re-written as it was shot. **TK** 

At any rate, the episode was "never finished" 

Except that it's been finished at least half a dozen times. Theres: 

- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency 
- The BBC's VHS/DVD release (featuring all the footage that was shot, plus some newly recorded narration.) 
- The Big Finish Audio Play 
- The Garath Roberts Novelization
- The Ian Levine Live Action/Animation Hybrid Edition
- The Animated BBC webcast (http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/webcasts/shada/) 
- This Fan Edit combining all the official footage with some new effects shots and audio from the Big Finish Audio Play 
- A fan novelization (http://doctorwho.org.nz/archive/shada/prologue.html)

And that's just scratching the surface. Shada has found its way in to all manner of *Doctor Who* related media. Not a bad afterlife for an unfinished serial, eh?
