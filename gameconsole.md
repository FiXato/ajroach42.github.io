I build things. Recent projects include: 
- [A Raspberry Pi Based Game Console](/gameconsole)
- Several games for said Console
- A new method of manufacturing LP Records. 
- This blog
- Several works of fiction
- Book and Comic Book Manufacturing

I'll post more about these projects (and others) in the coming weeks.
