I have recently encountered one of the funniest, most creative, and most moving peices of media I've consumed in recent memory. It's an article titled "[What Football Will Look Like in the Future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)." It's also a science fiction story about a world in which people live forever, and still act fantastically human. The story is presented from the point of view of "9", who is hurtling through space. The whole thing wonderful, and well done, and part four is due out in a few minutes.

Go spend 20 minutes getting to know 9 and 10 and Juice, and all of the cross country football players, then come back and [talk to me about it](https://cybre.space/@ajr).
