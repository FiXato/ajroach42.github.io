So here we are, someone finally made a decent LCARS interface for the Raspberry Pi. Check the code out on [Github](https://github.com/tobykurien/rpi_lcars), and then decide what you're going to build it in to. Check out a video of the system in action below.

I'm thinking I'll be embedding a few touch screens throughout my apartment (sorry Amber!) and setting them up with this UI to control our UPNP server, which streams video and audio to our TV and hi-fi system. Because it's awesome, and why wouldn't I do that?

At least I'm not threatening to do [this to the apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlrNKl4n8HI).
