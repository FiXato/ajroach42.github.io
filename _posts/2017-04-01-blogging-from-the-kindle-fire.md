I got a Kindle Fire HD for myself from Amazon. It's a little 7" tablet, with Amazon's off-brand Android. Why would I do this to myself? well, it was $25, refurbished, so that helps.

So far, it is actually a nice little device. I threw a USB OTG adapter on it, connected my new, ridiculously tiny mechanical keyboard, and now I'm off to the races. This is my first attempt at a regular blogpost with this strange little setup. We'll see how it goes, but I think it'll be a nice addition to my digital arsenal. 

(Now I just need to 3D print a good stand/clip for the tablet/keyboard combo...)
