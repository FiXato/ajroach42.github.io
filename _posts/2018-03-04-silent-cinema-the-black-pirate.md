Douglas Fairbanks' The Black Pirate. Originally released 1926. Presented here in black and white, it was originally shot in two strip technicolor. If you'd like to see it [in color (and lower quality) check here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Black_Pirate_(1926).webm)

This is a rip roaring adventure, and many feel it's Fairbanks' best film. I don't know that I'd go that far, but it's worth watching for sure.
