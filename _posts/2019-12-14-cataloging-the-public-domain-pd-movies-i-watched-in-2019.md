title: 'Cataloging the Public Domain - PD movies I watched in 2019 '
---
As part of my [Film Preservation project](http://ajroach42.com/preserving-old-film/), I am cataloginging all the public domain movies I watched this year. This blog post is taken from a [thread over on the fediverse](https://retro.social/@ajroach42/103302760478581781), and expanded a bit with links and the like. What follows is a list of more than 50 movies that are in the american public domain, along with links to those movies on various platforms, a short review/synopsis, and comments on the quality of the available prints. 

It's not presented in any particular order. I started chronologically from when I viewed them, but that fell off midway through because I switched media servers, and don't have data on when some of these were watched. Not every movie has a link, and not every link is the Canonical link for that film, but it should serve as a jumping point. 

# Public Domain Movies I watched in 2019

- The Shadow Strikes (1937): 
It's "THE SHADOW" in only the lightest sense of the word. It's really just a kind of light hearted mystery with the barest trappings of The Shadow. 

- The Shadow Returns (1946): Another movie that alleges to feature The Shadow. Another movie that mostly doesn't.

- The Shadow Laughs: 
This one isn't even about the shadow, they just took the name. It's a low budget, early talkie that appears to have been converted from silent to talkie half way through.  I don't see any redeeming qualities to it. 

- Star Odyssey (1979): 
Italian star wars? But not really, and just bad. Rarely even bad in an entertaining way. Has some small redeeming qualities, but not enough to recommend.

- Pimpernel Smith (!941): 
The scarlet pimpernel does WWII? Not really. Just a british Anti-nazi thriller. It's a spy movie, and an okay one. 

- The File on Thelma Jordon (1950): A stone cold film noir, with an absolutely top notch femme fatale. Good movie. (but way too dark for the holidays) 

- His Girl Friday (1940): 
It's the front page, but with a woman in the leading role, so it's a screwball romance comedy? Great interpretation of a Dark story

- DOA(1950):
A man who has been poisoned tells the cops about how it happened, and why, before he dies. Decent flick. 

- Nancy Drew Reporter (1939): 
Fun, low budget, kids flick. There's a car with a rumble seat, there's a musical number in a Chinese restaurant, I remember the movie being surprisingly tasteful for it's age and subject matter, I remember that I liked it, but not much else.

- Africa Screams (1949): Abbot and Costello do racism in the jungle. Not recommended. 

- Aelita: Queen of Mars (1924): Russian science fiction. Good, a little long. Silent. 

- The Brian that Wouldn't Die (1962): bad scifi horror. Fun, funny. 

- Blonde Ice (1948): I don't remember this movie at all. Let me read a synopsis. ... Oh, yeah I remember now! Great, atmospheric flick. Noir, with a strong femme fatale. Tense. Bad title. Not a holiday movie.

- The Front Page (1931): The same story as His Girl Friday, but without a woman in the lead, so even darker. I liked it, but many others did not. 

- Crime Inc. (1945): A man fights the mob from the newspaper! It's a decent movie. Not great, but good enough. 

- Roar of the Press (1941) a pseudo-sequel to The Front Page, except not as well made, and a little less dark. 

- My Favorite Brunette (1947): Bob hope sends up Sam Spade hardboilers. Excellent.

- Impact (1949): Noir, drama. Man survives murder attempt, drama ensues. Mostly a courtroom drama. Pretty okay. 

- Cause for Alarm (1951): A sick man terrorizes his wife, dies. The wife commits several crimes in an attempt to not get blamed for her husband's death. Surprisingly good. 

- Quicksand (1950): A stone classic. One of the all time great Noir films. A man steals $20 to impress a lady, and gets mired in metaphorical quicksand.

- Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror (1938): Basically Sherlock Holmes fights the Klan? Except it's not Holmes, and the Klan has a bedazzled snake logo. It's good, but feels like an early film. 

- Shoot to kill (1947): AKA Police Reporter. A former gangster is framed for murder. His wife and a reporter try to clear him. Clumsy, but not bad.

- No Time For Sergeants (1955): A TV movie (not the movie movie that came later), only available in pretty low quality, Andy Griffith joins the army, and gives his sergeant an aww shucks hard time. Really funny, but low quality print only. 

- Lady Gangster (1942): Lady robs a bank, goes to Jail. Shenanigans ensue. B- I could live without it. 

- Danger on Wheels (1940): A man drives a car dangerously. He races. There's a double cross. It's okay.

- The Stranger (1946): Orson Welles directs and stars in this movie about a former nazi hiding out in Connecticut. It's an absolute classic. Just a very good movie. 

- Teenagers From Outerspace (1959): ... Teenagers! From! Outerspace! There's a Lobster Monster! There's romance! There's socks OVER shoes. It's not good, but it's my favorite.

- British Intelligence (1940): mediocre spy film with Borris Karloff. Double cross on double cross. Not bad, just not good. 

- Texas, Brooklyn & Heaven (1948): A guy wants to be a novelist. A girl wants to run away. They meet up on a texas highway, move to Brooklyn, meet a gangster, and buy some animatronic elephants, or something. A cute, silly romcom.

- Speak Easily (1932): 
Buster Keaton in a talkie!  He's trying to fund a play. Everyone wants to sleep with him. It's silly. It's fun. 

- A Bucket of Blood (1959):
A cheap, cheap, cheap horror film. Roger Corman directs. A murderer disguises himself as an artist. It's not bad. 

- King Solomon's Mines (1937):
White people go on a safari. They find an African tribe and get stuck in an ancient mine and or volcano. Honestly not bad.

- Beat the Devil (1953): 
Bogart stars in a send up of the kind of noir picture he made famous. I think it's a really great film, but it flopped at the time. 

- Cat-Women of the Moon (1953): A secret society of Women on the Moon! With Mind Control! It's a decent movie. 

- Attack of the 50 foot Woman (1958) Space Radiation make a giant woman. It's not very good! It is super silly!

- Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973): Sex kills! At least, it does in this movie, where everyone is topless all the time. 

- Dick Tracy (1945): A feature film adaptation of Dick Tracy, really just more of a mild detective adventure. Not bad, just not remarkable. 

- House on Haunted Hill (1959): Locked room horror in a haunted house. What's real? What isn't? It's kind of silly, but I enjoy it.

- Robin Hood (1922): 
It's Robin Hood! It's Douglas Fairbanks! It's Silent! It's pretty good! 

- The General (1927): The best silent movie ever made, IMO. It's the story of the great train robbery (an event that happened in my home town during the US Civil War.

- Detour (1945): One of the best Poverty Row films ever. Recently re-released in HD for the first time. It's beautiful, it's the classic tale of an unreliable narrator in a bad situation that keeps getting worse.

- The Little Shop of Horrors (1950): Another low budget Corman horror comedy. It's funny, it's horrific. I like it. 

- The Mark of Zorro (1920): 

Zorro! It's silent! It's pretty good.

- Safety Last (1923): Harrold Lloyd's most recognizable feature. Silent. Slower than modern audiences expect, but still worth seeing. 

- International Crime (1938): The Shadow! (again!) But not really! (again!) My favorite of The Shadow feature films (but not as good as the serials.) 
 
- The Phantom Empire (1935): Gene Autry sings as bankers try to steal his ranch, and they discover an underground city full of robots!

- The Magic Sword (1962): 
Children's high fantasy adventure. It's great, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

- Menace from Outerspace: Rocky Jones Space Ranger! This is a movie made of episodes of Rocky Jones. It's pretty bad! But I love Rocky Jones, so I don't care. Better as a TV show than a Movie. 

- Crash of the Moons:
Same as above, but it's a better movie. 

## Yongary Monster from the Deep (1967):

Watch it on Wikipedia 

Korean Godzilla, basically. With everything that implies. 

## Topper Returns (1941): 

[Watch it on wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Topper_Returns.webm)
[Watch it on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Topper_Returns_41)


Topper is a kind of silly novel about a man getting frisky with a ghost. This is a movie in which that same man solves a murder, with the help of another ghost. Eventually made in to a [decent TV show](https://archive.org/search.php?query=topper&and[]=mediatype%3A%22movies%22&and[]=collection%3A%22classic_tv%22). 

## The Slowest Gun in the West (1960):

[Watch it on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/slowestguninthewest1960)


TV Movie with Jack Benny and Phil Silvers. A send-up of westerns, and of masculinity in general. Pretty good, if a little silly. Only available at TV resolution.  

Only one transfer available that I'm aware of, and that transfer has been re-encoded and reposted in a million places. It's an okay transfer, but I'd love to find a better one. 

## Plan 9 from Outerspace (1959):

Not actually the worst film ever made, but definitely in contention. Unintentionally funny, inept, etc. Bella Lugosi's last film. 

__The film was shot on 16mm film at full frame in the academy ratio, but intended for distribution as hard matte 16:9 film. Many versions of this movie that are in circulation return it to full frame. This is Not the [OAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)). Many of the sets and effects look much worse at 4:3 than they do at 16:9. For most films, this is a big deal, and I wold never suggest watching at something other than the original aspect ration. For this film... Eh, the full frame version has it's own charms that you miss in the widescreen edition. The choice is yours and yours alone.__ 

## Charade (1963):

[Watch it on Peertube](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/88fd2335-d511-48fc-80fc-90a2d7f1d841)[Watch it on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Charade19631080p)
[Watch it on Wikiepdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Charade_(1963).webm)

One of the best movies in the public domain. Sometimes called the last breath of the golden age of Hollywood. Carry Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Screwball romcom meets suspense thriller with spies and double crosses. Very enjoyable. 

__The soundtrack is still under copyright, so many version of this film in circulation have an edited soundtrack. The film is poorer for that. I believe all versions linked here retain the original soundtrack, and it is my understanding that it is legal to distribute the film with this soundtrack, but not to make modifications to the soundtrack. I am not a lawyer, your milage may varry.__

## Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966):

[Watch it redone with puppets! (on youtube, I'm sorry.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRWgT6FBXk) 

I think [this review from 366 weird movies](https://366weirdmovies.com/223-manos-the-hands-of-fate-1966/) says what needs to be said:

> Manos: the Hands of Fate demonstrates an important lesson: if applied consistently, incompetence can be a style. This narrative feature film was shot with a hand-wound 16 mm camera that could only capture thirty seconds of footage at a time. The camera was probably intended to be used by families making silent vacation films, and the results look exactly like a home movie from 1966, complete with barely adequate, dull coloration and hazy definition.  Since the protagonists are lost vacationers, it’s an oddly appropriate, if accidental, visual scheme, almost as if the movie is found documentary footage of a missing family, a la Blair Witch.

There was no sound on camera. Everything was overdubbed after the fact. The actors that deliver the voice perfomances are far fewer than those who appear on screen. And, in spite of all that, there's a weird kind of beauty to the film, and Torgo makes the whole thing worthwhile. 

It is one of my favorite movies, but unquestionably one of the worst ever finished. The score is good enough that I own a copy on LP. (Seriously, [check out this track](https://manoshandsoffate.bandcamp.com/track/a-house-divided-against-itself), or really just go pay attention to the soundtrack and the movie.), the dialogue has a wierd poetic meter. The pacing is wrong. The blocking is wrong. The directing is wrong. It's a trainwreck that has to be seen to be appreciated. 

__You'll see some folks claiming copyright over the newly restored 1080p version of the film. This is an interesting legal theory that has not been tested in court, and would likely not hold up, as restoration falls under "sweat of the brow" work, which is exempt from copyright protection in the US.__
