title: Hyperzine - Hypercard Zine now accepting submissions
---
There's a [new zine](https://crime.team/~hypercard/) accepting sumbissions now. It's all about, and built with Hypercard. I've [mentioned my love of hypercard](http://ajroach42.com/a-modern-office-with-vintage-hardware/) in the past, but I've never talked about it at length. So let's talk about the hyperzine, and hypercard in general. 

> 2018 is the year of HyperCard.

>The last version of HyperCard, 2.4.1, was released 20 years ago in 1998. In that time, it's maintained small communities of hobbyists maintaining their stacks and creating new art on old computers. HyperCard has been used by LGBT and other marginalized people to make interactive art representing their experiences.

>On the 20th anniversary of HyperCard's discontinuation, I want to pay tribute to the programming tool that started it all.
