title: "Angband: Gaming like it's 1980"
---

Angband is a sprawling rouge-like adventure game that has been under steady development since some point in the 80s. It's massive, ugly, difficult, and a great way to lost an entire weekend. Simply put, it's one of the most intense, difficult RPGs that you'll ever encounter.

You can play it in your browser, via The Internet Archive.

This is an older version, and it will not preserve your save files. I highly recommend that you [download the latest version](http://rephial.org/) if you're interested in playing it for more than a few minutes. 

You'll need the [Players Guide.](http://rephial.org/help/guide) and the [User Manual.](http://rephial.org/help/) Seriously, don't give up on the game until you've glanced through one of those documents. It's a real hoot. 

I lose a few hours a month to this game. Then I die, and in my anger I don't pick it up again for weeks (just in time to lose a few hours of the next month to it.) 

Give it a shot, you won't be disapointed.
