Ruby is a radio drama in the technoir cyberpunk milieu, a product of the 1980s, and of the [ZBS foundation](http://www.zbs.org/index_new.php). A while back, they released a [season of the show as a podcast.](http://wondery.com/wondery/shows/ruby/)

It has a bright, vaguely hopeful tone. The production values are super slick. It practically drips chrome and neon, but somehow manages to still be timely and excellent. This season has a markedly anti-media slant to it, but it's presented in a reasonably compelling fashion. It's full of clich√©s, but it wears the well. 

I've been on something of a cyberpunk kick recently, and this was a nice take on the concept.
