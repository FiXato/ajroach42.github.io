title: Writing Computer Games
---

I've played a lot of computer games over the last few weeks, I've already written about some of them, and I'll be writing about many of the others soon. In writing about and playing these computer games, I have found myself working out plots for games in a simular format. After a lot of back and forth, I overcame my own objections and started building.

## Why I'm building games

Mostly, because it's something I've wanted to do my whole life. Also, because I like writing fiction, and I want to experiment with new ways of presenting fiction to modern audiences. It helps that I've played some really great, and inspirational, games in the last few weeks. 

When I've thought about building games in the past, I've had a few objections. 

* I don't have time
* I don't want to learn a new programing language
* No one would play it
* I don't know what I would build 

These are the classic excuses that I've leaned on to stop myself from doing cool things for most of my life. Some of them were fairly valid (I mean, I worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for the last two years running [Analog Revolution](http://analogrevolution.com), so I really didn't have any time.) 

Thankfully, I've found solutions to all of these objections. I have plenty of time, now that the store is temporarily closed, the tools that I'm using to build the games are not far removed from the tools I already use as a web developer, it's not hard to convince people to try a game, and I've been brainstorming plots (without even meaning to) for close to two weeks now. 

## What games I'm building

To start with, I'm working on 3 short works of Interactive Fiction. Each is based around a particular gameplay style, and will be built around the exploration of a specific software mechanism. 

### Arcane Reclic Archives 
You take the role of an archivist in the infinite archives of a municipal museum. You're tasked with making sure the collections are in order, and fighting a small fight against entropy. 

Along the way, you meet George. He works for the musuem upstairs, and he's pretty sad. 

### Arcane Relic Retrieval: Help Desk 
When you took this job, you figured it would be pretty simple. 

### Arcane Relic Retrieval: Field Work


## How I'm building games 
As of right now, I'm working in Twine. I've already coded up a skeleton that I can use to manage inventory and character progress, and I've been working to create a customized and polished UI/UX for each title. 

It's important to me that the end result feel finished, polished, and fun. Be sure to subscribe to my newsletter for updates on this moving forward.
