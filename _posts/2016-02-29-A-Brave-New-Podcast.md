Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was adapted for radio, and broadcast as part of the CBS Radio Workshop on February 2nd, 1952. Huxley narrates the show himself. It's a great little radio drama, that I have been listening to on my (rather short) commute for the last two days. I’ve just finished it, and I wanted to share it with you all. Listen below:

As most readers are no doubt aware, Brave New World is Huxley’s 1932 Dystopian masterpiece, portraying a world in which psychological conditioning and manipulation has created a “perfect” society where everyone is “happy.” The audio adaptation is a little more heavy handed in it's handling of religion than the original novel. Well, really it's more heavy handed in it's handling of everything. There's less room for subtlety when you're condensing a 250 page novel in to an hour audio drama. 

It’s a chilling read, but it’s downright terrifying to listen to. All in all, the audio adaptation is a resounding success, which I can highly recommend.
