Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was adapted for radio, and broadcast as part of the CBS Radio Workshop on February 2nd, 1952. Huxley narrates the show himself. It's a great little radio drama, that I have been listening to on my (rather short) commute for the last two days. I’ve just finished it, and I wanted to share it with you all. Listen below:

As most readers are no doubt aware, Brave New World is Huxley’s 1932 Dystopian masterpiece, portraying a world in which psychological conditioning and manipulation has created a “perfect” society where everyone is “happy.” 

It’s a chilling read, but it’s downright terrifying to listen to. All in all, the audio adaptation is a resounding success, which I can highly recommend.
