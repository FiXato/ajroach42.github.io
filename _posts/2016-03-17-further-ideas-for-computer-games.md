title: Further Ideas for Computer Games
---



I recently posted about my desire to start [writing computer games](http://ajroach42.github.io/writing-computer-games/).

This is an occasionally updated list of ideas for other Computer Games or Interactive Fiction. I'm posting it here because it's more likely that I'll forget that it exists than it is that I'll ever use them. If you see something that strikes your fancy, [let me know!](mailto:ajroach42@gmail.com), and I'll probably actually implement it. 

- A game in which you control one of several Classic Fictional Monsters, and duke it out in an arena against other Classic Fiction Monsters, in a turn based RPG battle, complete with animated sprite action. _I, for one, would love to see Count Orlock, or Varny The Vampire, and Count Dracula going head to head._ 

- A Zorkian dungeon crawl, where the player character is essentially an IT Magician, resetting all the traps and rebooting all the magic devices before the next adventurer comes through. _I came up with this idea first, and it kind of evolved in to Arcane Relics Recovery: Help Desk, though this would have had a distinct flavor._ 

- Something about an illegal BBS being run on ancient computer hardware, in a dystopian future where all private encryption has been outlawed, and all computers are fitted with goverment mandated, DRM protected, surveilance software. _(I invision this game playing more like [Activision's Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(interactive_novel)) than like a traditional game.)_ 

- A massive, sprawling adventure game about Joan Carter - Warlord of Mars, set in a modified version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom. Joan is an ageless woman, transported to mars by means she can't understand, and tasked with: Learning the Martian languages, Becoming a feared warlord, Learning to pilot an airship, and ultimately marrying Martian Princess Dejah Thoris. This game will be fully illustrated and feature persistent geography. Additionally, it will have several procedurally generated areas, many interactive NPCs, hundreds of unique items, and thousands of possible paths to several 'winning' end conditions. _I've already planned a significant portion of this game, and built the skeleton on which the game will exist. It's a big project, and it's going to take a whie._ 

- *The Order of the Olive* was a secret society/running gag between myself and some friends in Middle and Highschool. I've always thought it would be a hoot to take the collected lore of the Order and turn it in to something that was 40% serious, 30% silly, and 30% absurd.

That's all for now, though I imagine I'll keep this updated as more ideas trickle in.
