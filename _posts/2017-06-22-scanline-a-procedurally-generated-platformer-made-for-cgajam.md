title: Scanline - A procedurally generated platformer made for cgajam.

Today I stumbled across [this excellent procedurally generated platformer for Windows and Linux](https://itch.io/jam/cga-jam/rate/151199). It's highly playable, surprisingly complex, effectively endless, and super fun. The CGA graphics lend it an air of nostalgic charm, but the gameplay feels wonderfully, deviously modern. It's free, and great.
