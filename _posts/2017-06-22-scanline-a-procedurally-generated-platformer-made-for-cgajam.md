title: Scanline - A procedurally generated platformer made for cgajam.

Today I stumbled across this excellent procedurally generated platformer for Windows and Linux. It's highly playable, surprisingly complex, effectively endless, and super fun. The CGA graphics lend it an air of nostalgic charm, but the gameplay feels wonderfully, deviously modern.
