title: Expedition Sasquatch - A comedy podcast about a bigfoot hunter
---
[Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org/), a comedy podcast about a southern gentleman who hunts bigfoot and tries to use a Tandy 1000 HX, is now available. We're still waiting on all the various podcast aggregators to throw their stamp of approval on it, but you can subscribe now from the homepage linked above. I had a ton of fun making this, and I'm really excited to share the subsequent episodes. And the ogg file linked is ogg/opus, which comes in under 1.44mb, making this my first official [FloppyCast](http://ajroach42.com/floppycasts-1-44mb-podcasts/).

I'm looking forward to releasing more, and I hope you enjoy.
