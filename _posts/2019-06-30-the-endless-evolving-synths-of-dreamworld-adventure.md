title: The Endless Evolving Synths of Dreamworld Adventure
---
Today, I stumbled across a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRNyJlpnOs&feature=youtu.be) about a peice of DOS shareware called Dreamworld Adventure that has an essentially endless, evolving, FM Synth soundtrack. It has ensared my brain, and I had to share it here. 

The game itself is honestly nothing special. It's a puzzle platformer in the vien of Klonoa, although uglier and from 1995. I've played it for a few minutes, it's fun enough. Difficulty ramps up really quickly, and there isn't much else to say about it. For as late as the game was released, it would be almost entirely unremarkable were it not for the soundtrack. 

But hoobuddy, what a soundtrack. Take a listen:

There's [an hour and change available there as an MP3 or OGG file](https://archive.org/details/dwa_002?webamp=default). 

If you have original hardware, and a way to transfer files to it, Gravis has also posted a raw rip of an hour and change of adlib code to Archive.org, which you can find on [the "show all" page](https://archive.org/download/dwa_002). It's the 322kb dro file. 

Seriously, this is a great find, and I'm really enjoying it today.
