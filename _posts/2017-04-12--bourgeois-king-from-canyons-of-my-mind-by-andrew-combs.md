You know what you need in your life? A swamp-rock protest song, with strong country and jazz influences. Something like [Bourgeois King](https://andrewcombs.bandcamp.com/track/bourgeois-king) from [Canyons of my Mind](https://andrewcombs.bandcamp.com/album/canyons-of-my-mind) by Andrew Combs. Seriously, this thing has it all. It's a foot-stomping, barn burning rock song, with guitars that sound like Lousiana or Texas garage, but then you notice the complex instrumentation (there's some overblown jazz flute!), and the lyrical content that is very much not typical of southern rock. It's wonderful! Listen:

Lyrics: 

> It’s all gone to hell in bourgeois city 
Buy a ticket for some fun 
Take a seat, and lord take pity 
It’s the mulching of America 

>Holographic talking people 
Coming from your tv screen 
See the church and see the steeple 
Praise to the bourgeois king 

>Parasites and politicians 
Intertwined and holding hands 
Feed us fiction and fabrication 
Make this country great again 

>Newspaper, headline story 
Who will stand for us and lead 
Cast your vote and do your duty 
Hail to the bourgeois king 

>We’ll build a wall to block the enemy 
Build a wall to keep us free 
Build a wall to block the enemy 
Build a wall to keep us free 

>We’ll build a wall to block the enemy 
Build a wall to keep us free 
Build a wall to block the enemy 
Build a wall to keep us free
