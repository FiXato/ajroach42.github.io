William Gibson wrote Neuromancer in a mad dash. It is his first novel. It defined the Cyberpunk genre. It's brutal, bloody, and more than a little dark. I've just finished listening to the audiobook, and I absolutely loved it. You can do the same.

The audio book has been posted to youtube. I don't know how long it will last there, so you may want to use something like [AllTubeDownload](https://alltubedownload.net/) to save a local copy of the mp3, so that you're not cut off in the middle.

I don't have much to say about the book itself. It's a wild ride. Think Philip K Dick, if he'd been able to handle his drugs, and he'd been writing 10 years later. It's more Blade Runner than Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. This is a good thing. 

It's got sentient computers, psudo-sentient computers, cyberspace, ageless corporate overlords, and a healthy dose of distrust for capitalism. 

It's about 8 hours long, and the perfect complement to a long commute.
