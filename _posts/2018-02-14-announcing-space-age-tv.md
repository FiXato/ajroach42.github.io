title: 'Announcing Space Age TV! '

It's time for Space Age TV! Space Age TV is a work in progress from the team behind Analog Revolution (that is to say, mostly just me right now.) Consider this your tour of early Sci-Fi TV.

The idea is pretty straightforward. I have an archive of more than 400 public domain episodes of Space Age TV from Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, Space Patrol, Rocky Jones, Space Ranger, Captain Video, Captain Z-Ro, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, and a handful of pre-TV film serials. I present those, with occasional additional commentary, in video podcast form. 

You can watch the first episode here:

I'm a big fan of Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. He's featured in the [current issue of A Brief History of the Future](https://spaceageideas.com/product/a-brief-history-of-the-future-winter-2017/), and I also have a collection of [Tom Corbett Radio Episodes](https://www.patreon.com/posts/tom-corbett-15725393), which will be featured in a Space Age Radio podcast soon.
