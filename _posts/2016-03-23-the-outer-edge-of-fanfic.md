title: The Outer Edge Of FanFic

Fan Fiction gets a bad rap, which the folks who give it a bad rap justify by pointing to countless poorly written, often highly sexual examples written by young people. On the other hand, there are works of FanFiction that rival or eclipse their cannon, and deserve greater respect than the monkier of FanFic currently affords them. Remixing is the future, embrace it. 

I'd like to shake things up, and highlight some examples of Fan Fiction that have already ascended beyond the current confines of the conotations of the form, to stand as worthwhile works on their own. Check it out: 

### [Sherlock Jr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlJmtedcnp4)

Watch Buster Keaton daydream about being the hero in this 1924 Sherlock Holmes Fan Film. 

### [Megaman x Streetfighter](http://www.capcom-unity.com/mega_man)

Mega Man X Streetfighter is a platformer in the style of the original Mega Man games, substituting Street Fighter characters in the place of the main bosses from Mega Man. It works to great effect. 

The game was originally developed as a fan project, and was eventually given Capcom's blessing. It's now available for free from Capcom and, frankly, it's pretty damn cool. 

### [My Own Kind of Freedom](http://www.dreamcafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/My-Own-Kind-of-Freedom-Steven-Brust.pdf)

My Own Kind of Freedom is a novel set in the Firefly 'verse. It was written by Steven Brust on spec. Whedon and Co. declined to publish it, so Brust has released it as a free download on his website. 

It is very true to the original characters, and is a thrill to read. 

### A Study in Emerald

### Star Trek Continues

### Fuzzy Nation

### Planetary

### Elementary

### Pride and Predjudice and Zombies

### Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency 

Started life as an unreleased episode of Doctor Who. 

At some point in the future, I'd like to explore more traditional works of Fan Fiction that, while they exist in a far more grey legal zone, deserve the same legitimacy as the above works.
