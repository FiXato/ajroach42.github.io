Leonard Cohen was an american songwriter, responsible for some of the most beautiful and moving tracks of the last 50 years. He passed away earlier this week at the age of 82. He will be missed. Cohen started his musical career in 1966 or 1967 when he wrote Suzanne, for Judy Collins. From there, he wrote dozens of other heartachingly beautiful songs, including: 

- Hallelujah (which was [a hit for Jeff Buckley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4)) 
- Dance me to the End of Love ([Sung here by The Civil Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0LZ4wMV3zw)) 
- Suzanne ([Judy Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyVavcfAzN8)) 
- Famous Blue Raincoat ([The man himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohk3DP5fMCg)) 

His most recent album was released last month. It is called You Want It Darker. I am listening to it for the first time now.

I think, in light of the recent election, that his track Democracy might be particularly poigneint today.

> It's coming through a hole in the air
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA

>It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the USA

>Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the Squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

>It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA

>It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
The river's going to weep,
And the mountain's going to shout Amen
It's coming like the tidal flood
Beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious
In amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA

>Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

>I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
As time cannot decay
I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to the USA
To the USA
