The was the first book of Hugh Howey's that I've read. I was introduced to it by Warren Ellis' newsletter [Orbital Operations](http://orbitaloperations.com).

I don't want to say too much about the novel, for fear of ruining the magnificent twists and turns it has in store for the reader, but I will say this: It's sci-fi. It's dark. It looks like it's a pulp-y, almost schlocky, thing, and then it's something else entirely. I saw a few of the twists up ahead, before I got to them. Others, I must admit, blindsided me. 

As I said, I can't recommend this novel highly enough. I originally picked it up as a series of Kindle Singles for $1/each. It's now available as a collected edition, both digitally and physically. I'm sorely tempted to buy myself a hardback or a paperback edition.
