</iframe>Last night, while having dinner with a friend, I was reminded of the excellent [Beacon 23](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544839633/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0544839633&linkCode=as2&tag=ajroach42-20&linkId=D4WLGN5ENAJDVAIJ) by [Hugh Howey](http://www.hughhowey.com/) which was originally serialized over a period of several months. The was the first book of Hugh Howey's that I've read. I was introduced to it by Warren Ellis' newsletter [Orbital Operations](http://orbitaloperations.com).

I don't want to say too much about the novel, for fear of ruining the magnificent twists and turns it has in store for the reader, but I will say this: It's sci-fi. It's dark. It looks like it's a pulp-y, almost schlocky, thing, and then it's something else entirely. I saw a few of the twists up ahead, before I got to them. Others, I must admit, blindsided me. 

As I said, I can't recommend this novel highly enough. I originally picked it up as a series of [Kindle Singles](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZB8DHC4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ZB8DHC4&linkCode=as2&tag=ajroach42-20&linkId=YMIWGTT7CYU2DCAT) for $1/each. It's now available as a [collected edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544839633/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0544839633&linkCode=as2&tag=ajroach42-20&linkId=D4WLGN5ENAJDVAIJ), both digitally and physically. I'm sorely tempted to buy myself a hardback or a paperback edition.
