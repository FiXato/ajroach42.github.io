I publish a quarterly Science Fiction pulp called A Brief History of the Future.This quarter just started, and that means there is a new issue available. I just got the proofs in the mail, and they look GREAT. 

This is the first issue that we've had professionally printed, as opposed to the Zine style we used for Winter 2016 and Spring 2017. This is also the first time I'm making the issues available outside of Patreon and Etsy. 

The magazine is [available now from Space Age Ideas](http://spaceageideas.com/product/a-brief-history-of-the-future-summer-2017).
