Japanese minimalist retailer Muji is getting in to the construction business. They're selling a simple, minimalist huts, installed for $28,000. If this offer wasn't Japan only, I could see it being very popular with the Tiny House movement in the US.

A place like this, with a small patch of land to farm, in an area with low property taxes and easy access to solar power and clean water would be several kinds of ideal. Throw a bunch of them together in to a little neighborhood, and you have a blueprint for a sustainable community.
