       Welcome to Zork!
    Zork is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within.
    In Zork, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
    Zork was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax and Arneson. 

So begins the grandfather of all adventure games. It was originally written in 1977. In 1979 the fledgling company Infocom began the long proccess of porting the massive mainframe game to home computer. In the proccess, it was made slightly friendlier (but only slightly!), and split in to three installments. It became the corner-stone of a software company that consistently dominated computer games sales until they were purchased by Activision in 1986. 

The original Zork is an absolutely massive game.
