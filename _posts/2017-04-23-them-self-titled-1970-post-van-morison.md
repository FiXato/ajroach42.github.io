In 1964 Them released _Gloria_ and changed the face of garage rock forever. In 1966, Van Morrison (the lead singer and principal songwriter of Them) left the band to persue a solo career. In 1970 Them released what is probably their best album, even though no one was paying attention.

Sometime after recording the sessions that became [Astro Sounds from beyond the year 2000](http://ajroach42.github.io/astro-sounds-from-beyond-the-year-2000/), legendary session musician Jerry Cole joined Them as a songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist. He brought a wild energy to the band, and drew on his expertise as a session musican, surf guitarist, and psych-rock master to create an album that is heavy, agressive, and somehow feels very polished without losing it's edge.

The album flopped. Them would break up for good a few years later. Doesn't matter, though. This 1970 Self Titled release showcases Jerry Cole at his prime, and it's worth listening to for that.
