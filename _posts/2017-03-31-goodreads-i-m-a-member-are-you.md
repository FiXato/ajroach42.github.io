When I was a kid, I'd read a book every two days (or sometimes, more.) I'm not positive, because I wasn't keeping track, but I don't think I read more than 10 books last year, or the year before. This, obviously, is unacceptable. So, being the good little tech user that I am, I've turned to a technical solution. 

I have recently set myself up an account on Goodreads, so that I can keep track of the books that I'm reading this year, and the things I want to read. This gives me a good incentive to keep reading (public shame.) If you're a goodreads user, [be my friend](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65312449-andrew-roach). You can see the books I've read, and what I thought of them. You can see what I'm reading now, and how far along I am. You can see what I want to read.

It's all pretty neat, and a great way for me to remind myself to keep reading. (It's not that I don't enjoy it! I'm just so easily distracted, and there's so much I want to do.) 

If you look at my currently reading shelf, you'll see that there are a lot of books on it. Some of those are physical books, that I continue reading when I'm in physical proximety to them, others are audio books that I listen to in the car, or ebooks that I read when I'm out and about. I'm not nearly as scatterbrained as my Currently Reading shelf makes me seem. 

Anyway, if you're a reader, come hang out on goodreads with me. It's pretty cool.
