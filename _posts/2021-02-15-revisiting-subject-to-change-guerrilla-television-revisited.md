title: 'Revisiting "Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited" '
---
I've just finished reading _Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television revisted_ by Deirdre Boyle, and I have some thoughts about it that I want to capture while they're fresh. This isn't a review, really, just a way for me to organize how I feel now that the book is over.

First, the title. "Subject to Change" was the name of the pilot that The Videofreex produced for CBS. ([I wrote about the Videofreex earlier](http://ajroach42.com/videofreex-early-diy-media-and-the-future/).) This is an odd title for this book, because the book is barely about The videofreex. A few of the freex merit a mention, and the story of Subject to Change is told, but the majority of the book focusses on three other video collectives. 

- TVTV - Top Value TV An SF based video collective, and the most "commercially successful" of the early video pioneers. Also the group that gave birth to the name "Guerilla Television"  
- Broadside TV - A Tennessee based group of Grassroots Video producers working to create local content for the appalachian region, in the folk school tradition. 
- UCV - University Community Video a Minneapolis based group, working with the University of Minnesota to teach video production and produce TV for their local closed circuit and eventually for local public access. 

The book chronicles the genesis of each of these groups, their triumphs, and their struggles. 

More pages are devoted to TVTV than the others, because TVTV started sooner, lasted longer, were better at chronicling their work, and have been better archived. Many of the people associated with TVTV went on to be very successful in traditional TV and movies, as did several of the UCV crew. The book makes a compelling case that TVTV was doomed from pretty early on, and that UCV struggled to find a model that could be sustainable. 

The only organization mentioned that seemed to have a clear vission, and a reasonable chance at success was, unfortuantely, the one that failed. This was more or less entirely the fault of the FCC under Nixon. 

Prior to the change in FCC rules, allowing cable TV operators to forego local content, Broadside TV might have had a viable long term model.
