I've long been a proponent of the idea that [Tapes are Cool](https://medium.com/@ANARevRecords/maybe-it-s-time-to-revisit-the-cassette-tape-865b6e3881a8#.j4rx42wwc). I'm a big fan of physical media in general (books, records, CDs, magazines, etc.) and I love the idea of a mixtape as a facet of curation and a method of physically gifting access to culture. 

Last year, when [writing on this topic](https://medium.com/@ANARevRecords/maybe-it-s-time-to-revisit-the-cassette-tape-865b6e3881a8#.j4rx42wwc), I said: 
> Cassettes are personal
Relationships have been built around mixtapes. A good mixtape takes time and care to craft, and the end result is far more significant and personal than a mix-CD or a playlist could ever hope to be.
What other format, in the history of recorded music, has ever been so intimate?

But I don't think that statement goes far enough towards establishing the significance of the mixtape as the one time steward of the secrets and traditions of musical culture. See, mixtapes were an important part of cultural transmission that has since been abandoned or lost. Cassette culture in general changed the way we thought about music. 

So let's look at some of the more important effects of cassette and mixtape culture, and explore ways to revitalize the mixtape:

### [Independent Experimental Audio](https://archive.org/details/noise-arch&tab=collection)

### The Grateful Dead

### Elsewhere 

### What even is a mixtape today?

Following from that I've started making mixtapes (both physically and digitally) of songs that are important to me, personally, and of songs that are important to the genres of music to which I listen the most. I'll be sharing some (digital and physical) copies of these mixtapes with my Newsletter Subscribers over the next few weeks. Be sure to [sign up.](http://tinyletter.com/ajroach42)
