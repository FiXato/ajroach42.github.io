title: Old Computers and gizmos for sale
---
I'm selling some old computers and other gizmos to make some extra cash and to make things easier for our upcoming move. This is a list of the things I still have available, along with a short description. I'll keep this up to date as things sell, and will provide additional photos upon request. See something you need? Reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ajroach42), the [fediverse](https://retro.social/@ajroach42), or send me an email (me at andrewroach.net). 

## Tandy 1000 EX 

I think it's working, but I've never tried to boot it up. Missing the expansion section cover, and does not have RAM expansion

$50 + shipping 

## Tandy 1000 HX

Definitely working, color monitor, RAM expansion, ISA to Tandy adapters, Tandy CF card hard drive, XT2IDE adapter. 

$300 + Shipping 

## Tandy 1000 (25-1000)

I got this right before the pandemic and I haven't turned it on yet. Includes greyscale monitor. The monitor works. I think the Tandy works. I'll check before I ship it and come down on the price if it doesn't. 

$150 + Shipping 

## C64

I have a couple. I'll get rid of at least one of them. Cases are yellowed. Vintage but working power supply (which should be replaced!), and AV cables included

$150 + shipping 

I also have: 

- a new power supply - $50 + shipping 
- a commodore monitor and chroma/luma cable - $100 + shipping 
- a 5 1/4 disc drive - $50 + shipping 

## Timex Sinclair 2068

Unknown working condition, no power supply. Everything on the board looks good, and it probably works, I just haven't had time to build a PSU 

(I really love this little computer and I'd like to get it working. It's a really neat machine, and everything that is good about it is the reason it didn't sell well and is tricky to work with today.)

$40 + shipping 


## OLPC XO-1 

I have two. One is working. One needs the firmware updated because it's firmware can't boot if the onboard clock is incorrect. I love this computer, too, and I will probably keep the working one? Maybe? I dunno.

Needs new firmware, no PSU - $50 + shipping
Working, with PSU - $100 + shipping

## HP Omnibooks 

I have several omnibooks. These are my favorite computers. I'll be keeping at least one of the AA battery powered ones, and maybe one of the later ones. The early omnibooks run on AA batteries and use Compact Flash cards in PCMCIA adapters for storage. They have monochrome screens, and will run for days or even weeks on a set of rechargable AAs. 

### HP Omnibook 300 

The first omnibook 300 is in nearly perfect cosmetic condition, with original manuals, rechargeable batteries (dead), power supply, and original box. Mouse is a little finicky sometimes. Has ROM card and CF based C drive. Runs on AA batteries. 

$450 + shipping

### HP Omnibook 300  

The second omnibook 300 has some scuffs and is missing the battery door. Has ROM card and CF based C drive. Runs on AA batteries.  No manuals, no power supply, no rechargeables, mouse is better. 

$250 + shipping 

### HP Omnibook 425 

The Omnibook 425 is in good cosmetic condition. No extras. I can supply a CF card for the C drive. 

$325 + shipping 

### HP Omnibook 600 

Later omnibook, does not use AAs. Dead battery. 

$125 + shipping 


### HP Omnibook 800 

Later omnibook, does not use AAs. Dead battery. 

$125 + shipping 

## HP 200 LX 

I have one HP 200 LX (doublespeed, 8MB upgrade). It's got some darkening around the edges of the screen, but works well and the screen is usable. Has a CF card in the PCMCIA slot with doublespeed driver. No serial cable or other accessories. 

$150 + shipping 

## HP Omnigo 

I have a couple of omnigo's These are neat. They're DOS machines that run GEOS, and have a touch screen. I'll keep one. I'll keep all of them if I can figure out a way to make them useful, but so far I haven't made them useful. 

$50, free shipping in the US. 

## Palm Pilots 

I have a lot of late era palms, including a tapwave Zodiac 2, palm T|X, e2, and lifedrive. (I love these. I'll keep a lifedrive, but I have more than one. I might keep the Zodiac.) 

Palm E2 - $45 
Palm T|X - $55 
Palm Life Drive - $65
