## Timex Sinclair 2068

Unknown working condition, no power supply. Everything on the board looks good, and it probably works, I just haven't had time to build a PSU 

(I really love this little computer and I'd like to get it working. It's a really neat machine, and everything that is good about it is the reason it didn't sell well and is tricky to work with today.)

$40 + shipping 


## OLPC XO-1 

I have two. One is working. One needs the firmware updated because it's firmware can't boot if the onboard clock is incorrect. I love this computer, too, and I will probably keep the working one? Maybe? I dunno.

Needs new firmware, no PSU - $50 + shipping

Working, with PSU - $100 + shipping

## HP Omnibooks 

I have several omnibooks. These are my favorite computers. I'll be keeping at least one of the AA battery powered ones, and maybe one of the later ones. The early omnibooks run on AA batteries and use Compact Flash cards in PCMCIA adapters for storage. They have monochrome screens, and will run for days or even weeks on a set of rechargable AAs. 

### HP Omnibook 300 

The first omnibook 300 is in nearly perfect cosmetic condition, with original manuals, rechargeable batteries (dead), power supply, and original box. Mouse is a little finicky sometimes. Has ROM card and CF based C drive. Runs on AA batteries. 

$450 + shipping

### HP Omnibook 300  

The second omnibook 300 has some scuffs and is missing the battery door. Has ROM card and CF based C drive. Runs on AA batteries.  No manuals, no power supply, no rechargeables, mouse is better. 

$250 + shipping 

### HP Omnibook 425 

The Omnibook 425 is in good cosmetic condition, has ROM card. No extras. I can supply a CF card for the C drive. 

$325 + shipping 

### HP Omnibook 600 

Later omnibook, does not use AAs. Dead battery. No PSU

$125 + shipping 


### HP Omnibook 800

## HP 200 LX 

I have one HP 200 LX (doublespeed, 8MB upgrade). It's got some darkening around the edges of the screen, but works well and the screen is usable. Has a CF card in the PCMCIA slot with doublespeed driver. No serial cable or other accessories. 

$150 + shipping 

## HP Omnigo 

I have a couple of omnigo's These are neat. They're DOS machines that run GEOS, and have a touch screen. I'll keep one. I'll keep all of them if I can figure out a way to make them useful, but so far I haven't made them useful. 

$50, free shipping in the US. 

## Lexicomp Gradebook

It’s a small (slightly larger than pocket sized) IBM PC compatible computer with a full sized keyboard and PCMCIA slot. Runs on AA batteries. Has a full serial and parallel port. If I could figure out how to make it see CF cards in the PCMCIA slot, I’d keep it, but so far, I have been unsuccessful in doing so (I’ll blame time, it looks like it should be doable. I could use an SRAM card instead, allegedly it can boot from those! but that doesn’t fit my current workflow.)

$125 shipped in the US



## Palm Pilots 

I have a lot of late era palms, including a tapwave Zodiac 2, palm TX, e2, and lifedrive. (I love these. I'll keep a lifedrive, but I have more than one. I might keep the Zodiac.)

I have some chargers and sync cables too, but not many. $15/each.

## Gateway Handbook 486
