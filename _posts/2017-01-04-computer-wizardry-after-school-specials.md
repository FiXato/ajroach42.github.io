In case you haven't noticed, I'm kind of a fan of 1970s and [1980s computer culture](https://medium.com/@ajroach42/a-modern-bbs-reviving-the-local-distributed-weird-precursor-to-facebook-4b3db93f742d#.68alg4rr5). (In fact, that facination heavily informs [my current project, Of Many Trades.](http://ofmanytrades.com)) One often overlooked aspect of early computer culture is the way it was covered in contemporary press. Presented here are two TV Documentaries, both filmed before the rise of the internet, that cover the home computer revolution at two pivotal points. 


## Hackers - Wizards of the Electronic Age

Shot in 1984, at a weekend computer conference (akin to the modern [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)) hosted by the [Whole Earth Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog)'s editors. It captures the spirit and energy of a group of people who knew they were changing the world, and had very different ideas of how to do it. 

"Hackers" spends most of it's runtime on interviews with [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) and other figures important to the commercial side of the Home Computer Revolution. To serve in the role of the more traditional DIY Hacker, they enlisted [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) who would later go on to found the GNU foundation, and serve as a key figure in the Free Software movement. 

Today, the devide between the "Commercial Software" world and the "[F(L)OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)" world is much wider. Stallman is considered by many to be a radical, while many of the other figures in the film have gone on to find various degrees of commercial success. 

Ultimately, "Hackers" is a great glimpse in to an often overlooked, and terribly important, facet of our recent history. It gives us a glimpse of a world on the brink of revolution, and the impression of alternate futures that never came to pass. 

## Terminal Madness

"Terminal Madness" was filmed 5 years earlier, by WMTV in Madison, Wisconsin.

## BBS: The Documentary

Straying from our original theme a bit is BBS: The Documentary. This is a multi-part series covering the history of the [local, weird precursor to the modern internet](https://medium.com/@ajroach42/a-modern-bbs-reviving-the-local-distributed-weird-precursor-to-facebook-4b3db93f742d#.68alg4rr5). It's awesome, and informative.
