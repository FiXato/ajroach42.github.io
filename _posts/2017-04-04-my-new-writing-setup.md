title: 'My New Writing Setup '
---
A few days ago, over on Boingboing, Rob Beschizza shared [his new writing setup](http://boingboing.net/2017/03/16/my-new-writing-setup.html). A plank keyboard, an old iMac, and some beautiful vintage speakers, tucked away in a corner of his abode. 

He said that he works this way because: 

> I'm one of those people who has trouble writing at length on my main machine, because of all the distractions it offers. Email and messaging and social networking: they all combine to form the "ludic loop" that Mark recently blogged about. 

After trying a few different "distraction free" writing environments, he came to the conclusion that he needed something that stayed out of his way when he was working (and, as a blogger, that meant it needed to be able to access the internet) but also didn't let him easily get distracted (meaning that feature rich websites should fail to load.) 

I used to do something similar with a Tandy 100 and an SSH server, but I've long since retired the Tandy. Reading his post, though, it became clear to me that I was encountering the same problems, and that my solutions up to that point hadn't actually solved it. 



I put together a new writing setup with a Kindle Fire tablet, a tiny mechanical keyboard, and some good headphones. It's not nearly as pretty as Rob's, and I'm still not sold on my tablet stand (a small, 3D printed Dragon), but I can't argue with the results. It also has the benefit of being incredibly portable. Couple that with Prose.io and Jekyll//github pages, and I have a writing rig that can really kick some ass. 

So far, it's working pretty well. Add in a [shell account from OfManyTrakdes](http://ofmanytrades.com), and I'm even able to do most of my coding on this little setup. I'm writing more, and more often. I feel better. 

There are distractions on the Fire, to be sure. (It's loaded down with books and comics, and has access to my Plex server, and all of my home media) but those are more intentional distractions. The feedback loop of:

- checking email, 
- checking facebook, 
- checking facebook messenger, 
- checking instagram, 
- checking tumblr, 
- checking twitter, etc. 

is tempered by the fact that I don't have apps for most of those platforms, and the mobile sites are slow enough that I don't feel an instant sense of gratification. The browser isn't horrible. If I wanted those things, I could get to them. It's just inconvient enough that I probably won't.
