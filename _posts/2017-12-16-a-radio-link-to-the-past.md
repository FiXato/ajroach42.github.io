title: A Radio Link to the Past
---
Recently, I set up an [Internet Radio Station featuring music from Archive.Org's Great 78 project](http://ajroach42.com/listen-like-it-s-1949/). While putting that together, it occured to me that a few of my relatives would absolutely adore a way to experience this music, but the quirks of media streaming seem to have left most of them behind. So, for the Holidays this year, I decided to make some Radios. Well, not Radios, but something Radio adjacent. A little box that endlessly loops through 5000+ songs from [Archive.org's Great 78 Project](https://great78.archive.org/), while being simple enough for even the least technologically inclined members of my family to figure it out.

I just finished the first one, built around [this little hickydoo from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019KPBD3S) which has a MicroSD card slot. It sounds pretty great, and is easy enough to use that I feel comfortable giving these to the grandparents. Plus, it's got that neat 60s Braun\\early 00s Apple industrial design to it, which makes it really feel like an artifact of a bygone era. 

The one I recieved is a little different from the picture. (Mine has gold trim instead of silver. It does not say YouMoon on the top, but does in the small blank section at the bottom-middle of the faceplate.) Otherwise, it's as pictured. I'm pleased with it, and I'm about to order 4 or 5 more. 

## Pros: 

- Cheap
- Easy to set up (just load the files on the microSD card) 
- Does not hum while it's being charged (a surprisingly common problem among devices of this nature) 
- Sound pretty good, especially considering the price and size 

## Cons: 

- Does not support shuffle
- Pressing the volume buttons acts as next/previous track. Holding the volume buttons adjusts the volume. This might be confusing to the targeted audience 
- Plays the songs in the order they were coppied on to the SD Card, with no way to modify this behavior 
- A little smaller than I'd like 

## Remaining Questions: 

- Does it support playlists? If it does, I can include three or four playlist files at the beginning of the SD Card with all of the files shuffles there. 
- Will it work reliably for many months? We'll find out, I'm sure. 
- Will anyone actually use it? I hope so, but we'll find out next weekend!
