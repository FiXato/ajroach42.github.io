title: A Radio Link to the Past

For the Holidays this year, I decided to make some Radios for some of the members of my family. Well, not Radios, but something Radio adjacent. It's a little box that endlessly loops through 5000+ songs from [Archive.org's Great 78 Project](https://great78.archive.org/), while being simple enough for even the least technologically inclined members of my family to figure it out. 

I just finished the first one, built around [this speaker from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019KPBD3S) which has a MicroSD card slot. It sounds pretty great, and works reasonably well. 

Next, I gotta figure out if it will support playlists.
