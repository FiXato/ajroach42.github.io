---
It's January First, 2018. Another year is behind us, and it left us with a lot of problems to solve, and a lot of work to do. This is my summation of the chief problems facing us in the new year, and a roadmap for the work I can do, we can do, to solve these problems, or at least mitigate them going forward. 

## Defining the problems we're facing 

### Corporate Media

### The modern Web is dangerous and unsafe 

### The modern Internet is dangerous and unsafe 

### The American Political landscape is terrifying 


## A Roadmap 

### DIY Media 

### The Internet without The Web 

### The Web without The Internet 

### Reclaiming American Politics


## Balancing The Work against My Life 

### Buying a new home// Living my values 

### Work vs. Life vs. Improving the world
