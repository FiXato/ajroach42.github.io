title: 'We Are Living In The Future and It''s Time To Start Acting Like It! '

It's January First, 2018. Another year is behind us, and it left us with a lot of problems to solve, and a lot of work to do. This is my summation of the chief problems facing us in the new year, and a roadmap for the work I can do, we can do, to solve these problems, or at least mitigate them going forward. 

## Defining the problems we're facing 

Lots of stuff is bad. Here's a quick rundown of the battles I'm picking, and how/why they are bad. 

### Corporate Media

[Writing about this recently](http://ajroach42.com/diy-media/) I said, with reference to the five media companies that currently control 90% of American media: 

> This media oligopoly is more dangerous than we often give it credit for. These five companies exert incredible power over our modern political landscape. (They are responsible for things like the DMCA, and the TPP, EME, and today’s Net Neutrality decision, in addition to our ever increasing copyright terms.)

>They collectively control so much of our political and economic landscape that it’s difficult to effectively understand, or begin to trace, the breadth of their influence. 

And that's true! But it's also a little obtuse. When I say that 5 copanies control 90% of American media, what I mean is 90% of what is broadcast on Telivion, screened in Movie Theaters, played on the Radio, or sold in stores comes from one of these five companies. 

The goals and views of these organizations shade everything they release, color our national discourse, and infect public opinion. Sometimes this is done in a benign or ever progressive fashion. 

Think about how many things you've seen in which the protagonist is a hardboiled cop on the edge that takes the law in to his own hands. The first season of The Expanse does this, but in space! Almost Human does this, but with Robots! It's Lethal Weapon, it's Die Hard, it's ubiquitous American media. 

And sometimes these companies wield influence accidentally. It is impossible for me to believe that Trump's presidenential campaign wasn't added by the [massive amount of free news coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html) he was given. 


### The modern Web is dangerous and unsafe 

[Parimal Satyal said it better than I can](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/). Here, have some quotes: 
>Today, we are so far from that initial vision of linking documents to share knowledge that it's hard to simply browse the web for information without constantly being asked to buy something, like something, follow someone, share the page on Facebook or sign up to some newsletter. All the while being tracked and profiled.

>Almost every website you go to today reports your activities to third parties that you most likely neither know nor trust. They record where you come from, what pages you visit, how long you stay on each, where you click and where you go next. In fact, since so many websites report to the same third parties, these companies can essentially have your web history on file as you go from link-to-link, website to website.

And, in case you think that this is ust about privacy: 

>The Leave campaign responsible for Brexit in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign both bought the services of a certain Cambridge Analytica, a company that boasts a gigantic database containing personal details amounting to "close to four or five thousand data points on every adult in the United States" (their own words). The goal? Craft hyper-personalized messages to change voting behavior based on your individual personalities, and by extension, your attitudes, opinions and fears. So if you are identified as a dad of three young kids in rural Texas, the message is nuanced to suggest that only a certain candidate will be able to protect your family against real or imagined threats. If you are identified as a patriot who's previously posted comments about gun rights and the second amendment, it might be about crime rates and how the opposition is trying to take your constitutional rights away from you.

and my favorite quote from the piece: 

> You become a manipulable data point at the mercy of big corporations who sell their ability to manipulate you based on the data you volunteer.

So, the modern web is dangerous. But part of what makes the modern web dangerous is the same thing that makes modern American media dangerous. Namely, the modern web is being used to craft propeganda and manipulate individuals in to implementing secret agendas in the global political sphere. 

It sounds like a nut-job conspiracy theory, until you start paying attention. 


### The modern Internet is dangerous and unsafe 

Yep, this is about [Net Neutrality](http://ajroach42.com/net-neutrality-the-consolidation-of-american-media-and-you/) again, but it's about more than that, too. It's about us running out of IPv4 addresses, and still refusing to roll outIPv6. It's about governments spying on their citizens. It's about ISPs blocking websites. 

Basically, the internet is in danger. There's a lot of opportunity for us to do neat stuff here, though. 

### The American Political landscape is terrifying 

Full stop. 

The NSA is spying on us. Corporations are spying on us. The governments and corporations that
