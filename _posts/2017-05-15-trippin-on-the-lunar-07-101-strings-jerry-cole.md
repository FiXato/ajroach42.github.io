In the past I have mentioned my affinity for [Jerry Cole, and Astro-Sounds from Beyond the Year 2000](ajroach42.github.io/astro-sounds-from-beyond-the-year-2000/), but I'm rocking out to this album again tonight, and I wanted to share this particularly excellent track. 

I have my stereo cranked as high as I can reasonably allow, and the whole office (which is empty except for myself) is bumping to Trippin' on the Lunar 07.
