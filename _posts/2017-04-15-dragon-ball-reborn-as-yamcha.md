title: 'Dragon Ball: Reborn As Yamcha'
---
There is a new Dragon Ball Manga, in which a student from our universe wakes up in Yamcha's body. He uses his knowledge of the DB Universe to become the mightest hero. It's the best idea I've ever heard. There's a scan/fan/translation up on imgur. (Embeded here.)

The second volume is due out soon, and I'm sure we'll get a translation of that shortly behind the release. 

I'll post about it here when we do.
