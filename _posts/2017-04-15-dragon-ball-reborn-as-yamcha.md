There is a new Dragon Ball Manga, in which a student from our universe wakes up in Yamcha's body. He uses his knowledge of the DB Universe to become the mightest hero. It's the best idea I've ever heard. There's a scan/fan/translation up on imgur. (Embeded here.)

I also [found a CBZ, for those that use comic readers](http://andrewroach.net/share/?f=158f2da6291454). 

The second volume is due out soon, and I'm sure we'll get a translation of that shortly behind the release.

I'll post about it here when we do.
