---

A lot of noise has been made of late re: chat interfaces and chat bots. People seem to think that they are new, revolutionary, and about to disrupt everything. No seriously, a lot of noise. Just look:

Early versions of Windows were just applications that ran on top of a command line interface, and they were pretty clumsy. If you wanted to get serious work done, you used the command line.
