The Candymen were a hard rock, bubblegum pop, and psychedelic band in the 60s. They Roy Orbison's backing band for a few years, and then they were a studio band out of Dothan, Alabama and/or Atlanta, Georgia. They released two albums of "Twist" related material, and two albums unrelated to the twist. A few years after the release of their last "Candymen" album, the exact same group of musicians became known as The Atlanta Rhythm Section (ARS). 

On their first non-twist related album, which was self titeld, they performed this Wild cover of T-Bone Walker's Stormy Monday Blues. There are days when I want to hear this kind of thing a lot. Today is one of those days.
