Call Tim Berner's Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) and [tell him you don't want DRM](http://defectivebydesign.org/blog/fourteen_days_dialup_and_save_web_drm) in your web standards. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, [but it is](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/so_youve_got_some_questions_do_you). It's like this: 

- DRM is software designed to restrict users rights
- It's illegal to break DRM, even if the thing you would be doing after you break the DRM is legal 
- It's illegal to perform security research on platforms containing DRM 

You don't want this, so call Tim Berners Lee (the only man who can stop this) and tell him you oppose DRM in browser standards. ![DialUp-1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/DialUp-1.png)
