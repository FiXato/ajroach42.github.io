Today, a co-worker and I were discussing Forbidden Planet, which lead me to [Space Patrol](http://ajroach42.com/space-patrol-1950/), and from Space Patrol through popular depictions of outerspace throughout the history of film. This is a list of media, most of which you can watch for free. 

I did a nice [long post-storm over on mastodon](https://retro.social/web/statuses/100761061839536611) where I talk about these films and TV shows. Then I realized I'd [done that before](https://retro.social/@ajroach42/99464946098268185) and talked about a lot of the same stuff. That made it clear that the time had come to document this collection somewhere other than social media, which brings us here. 

Items in this list are linked back to archive.org or wikimedia whenever possible.

# TV 

- [Space Patrol](https://archive.org/details/SpacePatrol-threatOfTheThormanoids1952) Space Patrol aired for roughly 1000 episodes. About 100 survive, because [we are shitty stewards of history](http://ajroach42.com/we-are-terrible-stewards-of-history/). 
- [Tom Corbett Space Cadet](https://archive.org/details/tomCorbettSpaceCadet-FightForSurvival1955) A rival series to Space Patrol, and contender for the crown of best loved space program. Also has roughly 100 episodes remaining. 
- [Rocky Jones Space Ranger](https://archive.org/details/rockyJonesSpaceRangerBeyondTheCurtainOfSpace1954)
- [Captain Video](https://archive.org/details/captainVideo-MiscEpisodeNo.51952)

# Film Serials

- [Buck Rogers (1939)](https://archive.org/details/Chapter11_201708) - Pay attention to the file order, the player has them out of order. 
- [Flash Gordon (1936)](https://archive.org/details/FlashGordonS01e07)
- [Radar Men from the Moon](https://archive.org/details/Radar_Men__from_the_Moon) (Leonard Nemoy makes an appearance in this one.)

- [The Spider's Web](https://archive.org/details/TheSpidersWebCliffhanger)

This is an incomplete list, and I'll keep adding to it as time goes on. 

I've mostly linked to single episodes, but multiple episodes are almost always available. And I'll be glad to answer any questions you have, I practically breathe this stuff. (come find me on Mastodon.)
