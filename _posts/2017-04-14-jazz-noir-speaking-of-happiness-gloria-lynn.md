I'm always on the lookout for songs that sound like they belong in the soundtracks of Noir films set in smokey nightclubs. When I heard [Speaking Of Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHwbrYVlENs) on the Resistance Radio soundtrack, it was exactly the kind of song I was looking for. I did some digging, and I was able to find the original rendition by an artist named Gloria Lynn.

Listen to that! It's got everything. The bass, the horns, the voice. It's all perfect.
