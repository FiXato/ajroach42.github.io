## The Future of Technology

I've been giving a lot of thought to what technologies that exist today will shape the world of tomorrow. Obviously, the era of the dedicated PC is over, and we are well in to the age of the smartphone. The watchwords of today are always some combination of "Smaller", "Cheaper", and "Faster", and that's all well and good. 

I'm glad to have tiny, inexpensive computers. They let me do neat things like building Game Consoles. But they are firmly technology of today. What's the technology of the future? 

A few days ago, I read [this article on Boingboing about some folks that made a 3-D scan](http://boingboing.net/2016/02/23/scanning-artists-de-loot-stole.html) (and print) of a looted Egyptian artifact, and I felt like I was living in the future. Decentralized manufacturing is, certainly, one of the biggest paradigim shifts of this generation, and I often feel like it's bredth and depth is underestimated. 

But it's not just manufacturing..
