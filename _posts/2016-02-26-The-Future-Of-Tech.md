title:The Future of Technology

I've been giving a lot of thought to what technologies that exist today will shape the world of tomorrow. Obviously, the era of the dedicated PC is over, and we are well in to the age of the smartphone. The watchwords of today are always some combination of "Smaller", "Cheaper", and "Faster", and that's all well and good. 

I'm glad to have tiny, inexpensive computers. They let me do neat things like building Game Consoles. But they are firmly technology of today. What's the technology of the future? 

A few days ago, I read [this article on Boingboing about some folks that made a 3-D scan](http://boingboing.net/2016/02/23/scanning-artists-de-loot-stole.html) (and print) of a looted Egyptian artifact, and I felt like I was living in the future. Decentralized manufacturing is, certainly, one of the biggest paradigim shifts of this generation, and I often feel like it's bredth and depth is underestimated. 

But it's not just manufacturing, many industries are on the verge of being distrupted by this trend towards decentralization, and I think that's great. Recently, I stumbled accross an ad for [GoTenna](http://gotenna.com) on facebook, and fell in love with their vision of a truley distributed and decentralized communications platform. 

Of course, GoTenna is currently used for Point to Point texts, ut's a tool to augment your smart device, not a replacement for the existing infrastructure, but it shows the potential for distributing and decentralizing communication chanels in a tangible (and powerful) way. 

Over the next several years, I imagine we'll see this explored in far greater depth. From projects like [PirateBox](https://piratebox.cc/) and the various [MeshNets](https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan) to more well funded (though no less ambitious) products like GoTenna. The future is local, distributed, decentralized, and weird. 

It's going to be fun.
