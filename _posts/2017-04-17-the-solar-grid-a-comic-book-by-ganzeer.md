I have been reading and enjoying [The Solar Grid by Ganzeer](http://thesolargrid.net/). He's doing a [kickstarter to release a hardback edition](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ganzeer/the-solar-grid-a-graphic-novel?ref=project_link) and it looks Absolutely Bueatiful. You can [read the first chapter for free](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrZsMfbHKUiTHE4Vmo0R0hDU0U/view). 


I first heard about this comic through [Warren Ellis](http://orbitaloperations.com/), who is far and away my favorite comics author. 

I'm not normally one to try and push kickstarter projects, but I very much want to see this one be successful. 

So, you know, go do the thing. ![The Solar Grid 01.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/The Solar Grid 01.png)
