I have been reading and enjoying [The Solar Grid by Ganzeer](http://thesolargrid.net/). He's doing a [kickstarter to release a hardback edition](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ganzeer/the-solar-grid-a-graphic-novel?ref=project_link) and it looks Absolutely Bueatiful. You can [read the first chapter for free](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrZsMfbHKUiTHE4Vmo0R0hDU0U/view).

The comic covers the daily life, and the politics, of a far future world which is wracked by drought and madness as a result of a destructive energy policy. It's black and white, dark, and haunting. The comic is currently self published, and serialized via [TheSolarGrid.net](http://TheSolarGrid.net).

I first heard about this comic through the newsletter of [Warren Ellis](http://orbitaloperations.com/), who is far and away my favorite comics author. If it has his seal of approval, you know it's going to be good. In this case, that was a bit of an understatement. In the first three chapters, Ganzeer has laid the framework for something truly groundbreaking. 

I'm not normally one to try and push kickstarter projects, but I very much want to see this one be successful. 

So, you know, [go do the thing](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ganzeer/the-solar-grid-a-graphic-novel?ref=project_link).
