title: Public Domain Movies on Peertube

I've been uploading movies to [Peertube](https://peertube.mastodon.host/video-channels/cda629a1-b4fa-40fb-be8a-342ba117a1fb/videos). Some of them are Very Good! Like Paper Bullets (embedded bellow)! Some of them are very bad! Like [Manos the Hands of Fate](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/2f7f8203-349e-4292-82ec-cd19e77a8817) or [Robot Monster](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/98920430-da69-4bf0-9b5a-7cc76bf75d8b).

I also put together another channel for [The Green Hornet Serial](https://peertube.mastodon.host/video-channels/greenhornet/videos).

All of these movies are in the Public Domain. You can download them yourself, from the links on the videos (or find them at higher bitrate via Archive.org.) So you can share them, remix them, remake them, breathe new life in to these old films. 

I'll upload a few videos every day, until I run out of space on my instance (and again, after I talk the admin in to giving me more space.) 

[Click through to peertube for the full list of films](https://peertube.mastodon.host/accounts/ajroach42/videos) available. Subscribe or comment if you feel led, and I'd appreciate it if you'd tell your friends.
