I'm Andrew. I'm a web developer, a technology blogger, and a record store owner from Kennesaw, GA. I write about technology, culture, techno-culture, and the often unexpected results of the collision of new technology and old culture. 

This blog is a bit of an experiment, if we're being honest. 

Let's see what happens.
