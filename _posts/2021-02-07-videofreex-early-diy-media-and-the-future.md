When researching the history of Video in [DIY Media](http://ajroach42.com/diy-media/) (or as Wikipedia is so fond of calling it, [Citizen Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_media) or [Participatory Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_media)), most popular accounts start with the release of the BMC-110 betamax movie camcorder by Sony in 1983. This is the first consumer Camcorder, it seems like a logical place to start. It isn't. Most popular accounts are wrong. This isn't surprising, [we're bad at this kind of thing](http://ajroach42.com/we-are-terrible-stewards-of-history/), and pretty much always have been. So, today, I want to spend a few bits talking about the first consumer video camera and tape recorder, [the Sony Portapak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portapak) released in 1967, and the DIY Media Revolution that wasn't. 

First, I have to give credit to [Gravis](https://twitter.com/gravislizard) \\ [Cathode Ray Dude](https://www.youtube.com/c/CathodeRayDude/videos) for openning my eyes with [this truely Excellent video on the history of consumer video formats from 67 - 83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Uc-JxJzYI). I live in this space, the tech and culture of the late 60s and early 70s are My Thing™️, and somehow in all the time I've spent in this space, I completely missed the early DIY TV movement. This, in some ways, blows my mind. In other ways, it highlights how Content Discovery is and will continue to be the defining problem of our generation (but that's it's own post, for another day.) 

If you get the chance, go watch the documentary linked above. It's great. If you just want to see the bits that inspired this post, they pick up around the 25 minute mark. 

## Why do people pretend home video started in 1967? 

This is, really, the easiest part of this story to understand. We, as a culture, have an exceptionally short memory, and an unnatual obsession with Firsts. The Sony Betamax Move Camera was (arguably) the first _Camcorder_. To modern readers who've grown up in the era after the introduction and subsequent ubiquity of the camcorder, that word is basically interchangable with "Video Camera", but they aren't the same word at all. 

A Camcorder is a video camera and a video recorder in the same package. For us to even need a word to describe that, seperate from Video Camera, implies the existence of video cameras and video recorders as distinct devices, and that is surely the case. 

## What existed prior to Betamax ?

Video tape has existed since the 50s in the commercial space. Until the advent of the [u-matic professional video tape format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-matic), "Video Tape" was largely the same as "Audio Tape" was before the introduction of the audio cassette. That is to say, it was a spool of magnetic ribbon that would get threaded by hand through the recording and playback mechanisms of a video tape recorder. 

Early professional video tape was usually in the [Quadroplex format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_videotape), it was about 2" thick, and used a playback mechanism the size of a standard pickup truck bed. It was a decidedly professional format.

But Open Reel Video Tape didn't *stay* a professional format. Starting in 1965, Sony introduced the [CV-2000 an open reel video tape format for home use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV-2000). It had limitations: It was black and white only, it was about [half the resolution of a standard TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_field), and it was fairly large and heavy, which ment it was primarily used for Time Shifting (much like Betmax and VHS in their early days.) 

*But*, and it's a big But, The CV-2000 was 1/10th the cost and 1/10th the size of a Quadroplex system. Half the resolution at 1/10th the cost and size? It's hard to argue with that. Of course, it would only get smaller (and occasionally cheaper) from there. 

Then, as I mentioned in the introduction, Sony introduced the Portapak in 1967. This was a shoulder slung, battery powered tape recorder and video camera, compatible with the CV-2000 and it marked the start of a Revolution in Media (even if [most folks didn't notice until 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Founding_and_initial_growth_(2005%E2%80%932006)).) 


## Why does this matter? 

The Portapak, and later the [EIAJ-1 and EIAJ-2 standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ-1) enabled consumers to create video media themselves for the first time. Prior to the portapak, consumer home movies were limited to 8mm and 16mm film. Film is great! It was in color, most of the time. It was Gorgeous, most of the time. But it was also usually short, usually silent, and very complex. 

Film is Cumbersome and Expensive, and frankly every problem these early video tape players had is completely overshadowed by the facts that tape: 
- was much cheaper, 
- enabled recording for longer lengths of time (half an hour or more, as opposed to 3 - 5 minutes for film), and 
- was easier to edit and re-use (it's magnetic tape, it can be erased and over-written.) 

As early as 1969, the potential of Home Video was making waves. Activists, artists, and various countercultures embraced the potential of creating their own television. They knew what they were doing. 

Here, for example, is a video of [The Videofreex interviewing Fred Hampton in 1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIbeTS8G5co), a few months before he would be murdered by the Chicago Police Department, while Bobby Seale was on trial in a kangaroo court for conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot. 

At the same time, The [Raindance Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raindance_Foundation) was publishing the magazine [Radical Software](https://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/index.html) 


The Videofreex produced this concert film in 1970:

and 



## What does this mean for the future?
