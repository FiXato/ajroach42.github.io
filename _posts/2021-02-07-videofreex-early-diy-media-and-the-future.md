title: 'VideoFreex, Early DIY Media, and The Future'
---
When researching the history of Video in [DIY Media](http://ajroach42.com/diy-media/) (or as Wikipedia is so fond of calling it, [Citizen Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_media) or [Participatory Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_media)), most popular accounts start with the release of the BMC-110 betamax movie camcorder by Sony in 1983. This is the first consumer Camcorder, it seems like a logical place to start. It isn't. Most popular accounts are wrong. This isn't surprising, [we're bad at this kind of thing](http://ajroach42.com/we-are-terrible-stewards-of-history/), and pretty much always have been. So, today, I want to spend a few bits talking about the first consumer video camera and tape recorder, [the Sony Portapak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portapak) released in 1967, and the DIY Media Revolution that wasn't. 

First, I have to give credit to [Gravis](https://twitter.com/gravislizard) \\ [Cathode Ray Dude](https://www.youtube.com/c/CathodeRayDude/videos) for openning my eyes with [this truely Excellent video on the history of consumer video formats from 67 - 83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Uc-JxJzYI). I live in this space, the tech and culture of the late 60s and early 70s are My Thing™️, and somehow in all the time I've spent in this space, I completely missed the early DIY TV movement. This, in some ways, blows my mind. In other ways, it highlights how Content Discovery is and will continue to be the defining problem of our generation (but that's it's own post, for another day.) 

If you get the chance, go watch the documentary linked above. It's great. If you just want to see the bits that inspired this post, they pick up around the 25 minute mark. 

## Why do people pretend home video started in 1967? 

This is, really, the easiest part of this story to understand. We, as a culture, have an exceptionally short memory, and an unnatual obsession with Firsts. The Sony Betamax Move Camera was (arguably) the first _Camcorder_. To modern readers who've grown up in the era after the introduction and subsequent ubiquity of the camcorder, that word is basically interchangable with "Video Camera", but they aren't the same word at all. 

A Camcorder is a video camera and a video recorder in the same package. For us to even need a word to describe that, seperate from Video Camera, implies the existence of video cameras and video recorders as distinct devices, and that is surely the case. 

## What existed prior to Betamax ?

Video tape has existed since the 50s in the commercial space. Until the advent of the [u-matic professional video tape format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-matic), "Video Tape" was largely the same as "Audio Tape" was before the introduction of the audio cassette. That is to say, it was a spool of magnetic ribbon that would get threaded by hand through the recording and playback mechanisms of a video tape recorder. 

Early professional video tape was usually in the [Quadroplex format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_videotape), it was about 2" thick, and used a playback mechanism the size of a standard pickup truck bed. It was a decidedly professional format.

But Open Reel Video Tape didn't *stay* a professional format. Starting in 1965, Sony introduced the [CV-2000 an open reel video tape format for home use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV-2000). It had limitations: It was black and white only, it was about [half the resolution of a standard TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_field), and it was fairly large and heavy, which ment it was primarily used for Time Shifting (much like Betmax and VHS in their early days.) 

*But*, and it's a big But, The CV-2000 was 1/10th the cost and 1/10th the size of a Quadroplex system. Half the resolution at 1/10th the cost and size? It's hard to argue with that. Of course, it would only get smaller (and occasionally cheaper) from there. 

Then, as I mentioned in the introduction, Sony introduced the Portapak in 1967. This was a shoulder slung, battery powered tape recorder and video camera, compatible with the CV-2000 and it marked the start of a Revolution in Media (even if [most folks didn't notice until 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Founding_and_initial_growth_(2005%E2%80%932006)).) 


## Why does this matter? 

The Portapak, and later the [EIAJ-1 and EIAJ-2 standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ-1) enabled consumers to create video media themselves for the first time. Prior to the portapak, consumer home movies were limited to 8mm and 16mm film. Film is great! It was in color, most of the time. It was Gorgeous, most of the time. But it was also usually short, usually silent, and very complex. 

Film is Cumbersome and Expensive, and frankly every problem these early video tape players had is completely overshadowed by the facts that tape: 
- was much cheaper, 
- enabled recording for longer lengths of time (half an hour or more, as opposed to 3 - 5 minutes for film), and 
- was easier to edit and re-use (it's magnetic tape, it can be erased and over-written.) 

As early as 1969, the potential of Home Video was making waves. Activists, artists, and various countercultures embraced the potential of creating their own television. They knew what they were doing. 

One such group is the NY based artist collective known as [The Videofreex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videofreex) or The Media Bus. Some of their footage survives on youtube, but most of it is now locked behind Expensive paywalls. These folks covered the gamut. 

Here, for example, is a video of [The Videofreex interviewing Fred Hampton in 1969](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIbeTS8G5co), a few months before he would be murdered by the Chicago Police Department, while Bobby Seale was on trial in a kangaroo court for conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot. 

They also filmed concerts, and produced local news! 

The Videofreex produced this concert film in 1970:

and [here is a link to the local news show they broadcast on the pirate TV station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFkeoVkQUe8) they ran using a television transmitter given to them by Abbie Hoffman. 

(There is a doucmentary about The Videofreex available on iTunes called Here Come the Videofreex, that frankly deserves to be liberated.) 

On the other coast, [TVTV was creating independent media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVTV_(video_collective)). Here's an example of work from TVTV, including one of Bill Murray's first performances.

At the same time, The [Raindance Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raindance_Foundation) was publishing the magazine [Radical Software](https://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/index.html), the [first issue](https://archive.org/details/radsoft-0101) of which contains these blistering lines: 

> Global information is the natural enemy of local government, for it reveals the true context in
which that government is operating. Global television is directly responsible for the political
turmoil that is increasing around the world today. The political establishments sense this
and are beginning to react. But it's too late. Television makes it impossible for governments
to maintain the illusion of sovereignty and separatism which are essential for their existence .
Television is one of the most revolutionary tools in the entire spectrum of technoanarchy

>Television, like the computer, is a sleeping giant. But those who are beginning to use it in
revolutionary new ways are very much awake. The first generation of television babies has
reached maturity having watched 15,000 hours of television while completing only 10,000
hours of formal education through high school. Yet television itself still has not left the
breast of commercial sponsorship. Just as cinema had imitated theater for seventy years,
television has imitated cinema imitating theater for twenty years. But the new generation
with its transnational interplanetary video consciousness will not tolerate the miniaturized
vaudeville that is television as presently employed. We will liberate the media. 

In many ways, it smacks of the kind of self-aggrandizing common to many would-be thought leaders in San Fransisco circa 1969. The same kind of techno-utopian thinking that produced Computer-Lib/Dream Machines and gave birth to the idea technology was an unmitigated force for good. (Spoiler alert: It ain't. Technology is a tool, a force multiplyer. If it makes things better, or if it makes things worse, that is as a result of the intentions and shortcomings of the people who wield it.)

However, while I probably would not have phrased things the way they are phrased above, I can't argue with the base sentiment (hell, I've spent the last decade of my life arguing along side it!) We can, and must, and in many cases Have liberated the media. 

2020 saw massive, nationwide protests against police brutality culminating in what many have described as Police Riots. These Police Riots have been documented by citizen journalists, and collected and sorted and verified by regular people. This [thread on Twitter, for example, contains still images and video footage of more than 900 instances of police violence](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1331630328469917697), directly in response to peacful protests against police violence. 

This is footage that would not be in circulation without the 

2016 proved to us, again, the power of the media. Late 2020 and Early 2021 have demonstrated to us, again, the potential destructive power of DIY Media when used to sew hatred and spread baseless conspiracy theories. [Youtube is radicalizing teens](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-youtube-pulled-these-men-down-a-vortex-of-far-right-hate) in to far right ideologies (which is a perfect example of the problems of Content Discovery I aluded to above, but is still a topic for another post.) 

Participatory media is as powerful as the activitsts of the 60s and 70s thought it would be, and it has been weaponized by far right racist extremists as a recruiting tool. 

 



## What does this mean for the future?
