When researching the history of Video in [DIY Media](http://ajroach42.com/diy-media/) (or as Wikipedia is so fond of calling it, [Citizen Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_media) or [Participatory Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_media)), most popular accounts start with the release of the BMC-110 betamax movie camcorder by Sony in 1983. This is the first consumer Camcorder, it seems like a logical place to start. It isn't. Most popular accounts are wrong. This isn't surprising, [we're bad at this kind of thing](http://ajroach42.com/we-are-terrible-stewards-of-history/), and pretty much always have been. So, today, I want to spend a few bits talking about the first consumer video camera and tape recorder, [the Sony Portapak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portapak) released in 1967, and the DIY Media Revolution that wasn't.
