After my disapointment with [Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](http://andrewroach.net/silent-cinema-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde-1920/), I decided to look for something a little stranger. What I found was There It Is! It's a 1928 sureal, absurdist commedy, that's pretty heavy on Special Effects and stop-motion animation. It's weird and wacky, and remarkably well done. Far more well executed than many of it's contemporaries. You gotta check it out.
