After my disapointment with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I decided to look for something a little stranger. What I found was This Is It! It's a 1928 sureal, absurdist commedy, that's pretty heavy on Special Effects and stop-motion animation. It's weird and wacky, and remarkably well done. Far more well executed than many of it's contemporaries. You gotta check it out.
