title: Tiny DOS computers
---
I have a bunch of [tiny DOS computers for sale (among other things)](http://ajroach42.com/old-computers-and-gizmos-for-sale/) and some of the DOS machines are super weird, so I wanted to take a minute to talk about them, their strengths, and the kinds of flaws, comprimises, and limitations that only Early 90s computers have. 

Machines I'm discussing: 

- HP Omnibook (300, 425, 600, 800) 
- HP 200 LX 
- HP Omnigo
- Gateway Handbook 486
- Toshiba Libretto 50 CT 
- Lexicomp Gradebook

## HP Omnibooks

The HP Omnibook 300 and 425 are my favorite machines on this list. 

I use a 300, with the ROM card out of a 425. That doesn't matter much. 

Let's talk pros (many) and cons (not as many, but some of them are Bad.) 

Pros: several days of use on a set of rechargeable AAs, small and light, good keyboard, CF cards, serial port. Other stuff. 

Cons: Slow CPU, limited RAM, black and white screen, no back light, no video out, Windows 3.1 in ROM, Very Stiff Keys

A lot of people look at the omnibooks and see a perfect writing machine. 

I did! 

And mostly, it is. It has a word processor and a text editor in ROM, it'll run DOS and early Windows apps. It'll save to an external drive, or let you sync over serial (which can be done wirelessly.) 

But that stiff keyboard can be a complete deal breaker for some folks and it's worth calling out. It does not get better, although I got used to it really quickly and I like it.

For the Omnibook 300 and 425, the PCMCIA slots are non-standard, or the BIOS is non-standard or something. Some PCMCIA cards won't work, even though it seems like they should. I don't know why. And they must boot from it's ROM. Without the ROM card, you can't turn it on, you can't boot anything other than DOS/Win3.1. 

Now, the other omnibooks:

The later omnibooks use recharagable batteries, which are mostly dead these days. 

Otherwise, they're capable Windows 95/98 machines. They're Tiny, and they have some compromises in terms of feature set and performance, but they're pretty standard laptops all things considered. 

The Omnibook 800 is my favorite Windows 98 laptop.
