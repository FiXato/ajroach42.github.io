Apparently today is Andrew Talks about Pico-8 day. (See [Tempest](http://ajroach42.github.io/tempest-a-survival-roguelike-in-pico-8/), [Combo Pool](http://ajroach42.github.io/combo-pool-a-pico-8-puzzle-game/)) Following that same line of thought, [here is an Excellent demake of StarFox for the Pico 8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28067). It's in 3D, it's got a rockin' soundtrack, and it's an absolute technical marvel.

The developer behind the project released the [3D library as a seperate piece of code.](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28077)
