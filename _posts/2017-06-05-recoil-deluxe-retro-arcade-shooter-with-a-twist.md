Recoil Deluxe is a retro style arcade shooter by viTekiM. It's available pay-what-you-want on [itch.io](https://vitekim.itch.io/recoil). It takes the traditional Astroids game and puts it through some clever twists, including an array of powerups, a recoil mechanic when you fire, and directly linking the throttle and the cannon. I've been playing it, and I think it's great.
