While I'm looking for work in DC/Maryland/Virgina, I need some suplemental income. As a result, I'm soliciting freelance work, and looking to take on new freelance clients. 

I'm a web developer, and a creative problem solver. I can do things with computers that will make you question my sanity. (As in, "What sane person would ever connect a 30+ year old laptop to the internet? And who would run their life from that laptop for years?") 

Are you intersted in working with me?
