My friend has been having a rough time, and she's going to be stuck at home for a few days, so I'm putting together a big ol' list of media in the public domain for her to kill time with. Sickness not required to enjoy.

Okay, let's do this. 

1) Comic Books: 
   - [Comic Book Plus](http://comicbookplus.com/) is a giant respository of free/public domain comic books. You can read them in your browser or ceate a free account and download them. Some of the stuff there is really good. Like these 
   - [Amazing Mystery Funnies](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=914) (actually mostly a sci-fi adventure comic)
   - [Planet Comics](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=878) 
   - [Space Adventures](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=1228)
   - [Atomic Mouse](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=1171)

2) Novels:
   - [The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha Christie](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/863)
   - [The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1155)
   - [The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2852)
   - [Little Fuzzy by H. Beam Piper](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137)
   - [Various Stories by Philip K Dick](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/33399)
   - [My Man Jeeves by P.G. Wodehouse](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164) 

3) Movies 
   - [Detour - 1945 Crime Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YuNQ9TBdF4&t=1929s)
   - [A Farewell To Arms - 1938 - With Gary Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9rWN4nUvBE)
   - [His Girl Friday - With Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kpXX501COc)
   - [Charade - With Cary Grant & Audrey Hepburn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7s0H9Qz168)
 
 
Of course, this is just the tip of a fairly large iceburg, but that should be enough to get anyone through a day or two.
