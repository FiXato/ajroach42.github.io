This 1913 Silent, Feature Length, Science Fiction Film is the first science fiction movie to be made in the UK. Long considered a lost film, it was meticulously restored by the British Film Institute in 2014, and it looks fantastic. I haven't watched it yet, but I'm looking forward to spending some time with it today.
