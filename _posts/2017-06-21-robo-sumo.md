Robo Sumo is a thing, and it's crazy to watch.

What is the best part of the movie Big Hero Six? If you said anything other than the implication that there is a secret, illegal, semi-autonomous [underground bot fighting league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLzdADKt06k), you're clearly wrong. I have wanted to take part in robot street fighting since I first saw Cubix and first played Robobon when I was in Middle School. So, when I found out about Robo Sumo, I knew I had to take part. 

Watch this video, where autonomous robots fight each other, all speedy quick.

Of course, I shared this video with many of my coworkers. I discovered that essentially ever member of my office has had the same dream. There have been a couple of RoboSumo leagues in the DC area in the recent past, but it appears that most of them are currently defunct. 

But I work with some programers, electrical engineers, and general nerds. Between us, we should be able to make a couple of autonomous robots beat the crap out of each other, right? 

So I'm researching kits. There's [this mostly complete robot from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1639) for $100 (just add microcontroller and code), or [this robot chassis for $20](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3216) (which needs power, microcontrollers, and a motor controler, plus some armor.) 

If you were building a sumo bot, how would you go about it?
