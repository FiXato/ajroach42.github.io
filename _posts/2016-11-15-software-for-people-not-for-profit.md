title: 'Software for People (not for profit) '

A while ago, I read an excellent artcile on Human Scale/Anti-Capitalist technology by [Jesse Kriss on Medium](https://medium.com/@jkriss). In it, he made some particularly salient points about the ways that technology fails us when it is made "at scale" and for profit. 

The whole piece is worth a read; it comes with my strong reccomendation. Today, I want to focus on a few specific points. 

>Software and services that are supposed to make life better are becoming unreliable and untrustworthy. It is increasingly clear that our interests, as software-using humans, are diverging from the interests of software companies.

>I am coming to the conclusion that we simply can’t rely on corporations to produce and maintain great, reliable, human-centered software. The systems and incentives are in direct conflict.

And then, later in the same piece: 

>Scale is a trap.
>So much of the complexity of web engineering comes from questions of scale. But why do we need scale? If we are trying to build humane software, there are significant benefits to keeping things smaller and simpler. If you want to run something for hundreds of people–or even thousands–that is entirely sustainable on a single cheap shared server.

Here we are presented with a few interesting ideas. 1) modern websites, like facebook, are massive and expensive to manage. 2) Facebook does not have it's users best interest at heart. 3) A platform that has it's users best interest at heart does not have to be massive or expensive to manage. 

Those three things, taken together, paint a pretty interesting picture of what the internet might become, or what it might have been.
