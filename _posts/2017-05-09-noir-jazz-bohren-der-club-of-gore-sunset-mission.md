Recently, I have been on a kick to find an album that perfectly encapsulates the way I feel when I watch old crime dramas. I came close with the non-album single [Speaking of Happiness by Gloria Lynn](http://ajroach42.github.io/jazz-noir-speaking-of-happiness-gloria-lynn/), but it's just one song, and it kind of steps away from the smokey crime noir feel at the end. Miles Davis' 1957 soundtrack [Ascenseur pour l'Ã©chafaud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc4tT-55ZzI) comes pretty close to scratching that itch, as does the soundtrack to Anatomy of a Murder.

At the end of the day, though, Sunset Mission by Bohren & Der Club of Gore is the best example of the moods, the emotions, and the sounds that I think of when I imagine the 1930s that never was.
