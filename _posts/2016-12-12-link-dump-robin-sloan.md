title: Link Dump (Robin Sloan)
---
Recently, I've discovered an author. His name is Robin Sloan, and he writes things that resonate with me, including the Wonderful Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour bookstore, which is likely my favorite novel of the last ten years. Sloan is also a fairly prolific essayist, and some of his essays touch on ideas that are important and realted to the [work that I do](http://ofmanytrades.com). This is a quick collection of links to some of his essays, projects, and short stories--along with a brief description of each--(posted half for personal reference.)

The ghost of Virtual communities can live on long after their humans have left. 

## [Making Culture for the Internet](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/making-culture-internets/)
It's really "The Internets", if you think about it.
