[Pico Monsters](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4046) is a pokemon style RPG for Pico 8. (If you're new to Pico-8, see: [Pico Fox](http://ajroach42.github.io/pico-fox-star-fox-for-pico-8/), [Combo Pool](http://ajroach42.github.io/combo-pool-a-pico-8-puzzle-game/), [Tempest](http://ajroach42.github.io/tempest-a-survival-roguelike-in-pico-8/)) It is very short, but the bits that are there have been well excecuted.

I'd love to see the game expanded upon, or to see someone else do more in a similar space.
