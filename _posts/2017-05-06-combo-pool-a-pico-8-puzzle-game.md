While we're [on the subject of Pico 8](http://ajroach42.github.io/tempest-a-survival-roguelike-in-pico-8/) , here is [combo pool!](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=3467)! This is one of my all time favorite Pico 8 games, and it's an absolute blast to play.

It's a fun little puzzle game that is modeled loosely after marbles or pool. It seems simple, but don't let that disuade you. There is room for deep strategy, and the game is a lot of fun. 

This is a great example of the kind of interesting content being produced for Pico-8. If you haven't already, I highly recommend jumping on that train.
