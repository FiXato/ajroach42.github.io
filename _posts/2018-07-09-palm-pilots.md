A few weeks ago, spurred by my continuing facination with technology that we have otherwise left behind, I purchased several small, touch screen, pocket computers manufactured by PalmOne. Calling them 'palm pilots' is a bit of a misnomer, but it's close enough. Specifically, I got a tx, an e2, and a lifedrive. What follows are impressions after several weeks of hands on use.

## The Good

The first device I recieved was a Lifedrive. It's a 4GB external HDD with a screen. I paid about $12 for it. Can't beat the price. I followed that up with a TX and two e2s, all in great working order, for an average price of $15/unit. I carried one of each for at least a week, before landing on the TX as my model of preference. 

These are fun little devices, and they have a lot going for them in terms of utility:

- In standby, the battery lasts weeks
- In active use, the battery still lasts several days
- There is a surprising amount of interesting and useful software still available (and almost always for free) 
- The TX and the Lifedrive make solid little video players, all three make passable music players
- Did I mention the battery lasts for days?
- Palm desktop is a treat to us, and is very well thought through.
- The lifedrive is the slowest of the three devices, and even it was often more responsive than a modern PC. The e2 and the TX practically sing. 

## The Bad

It isn't all roses. Some stuff doesn't work well:

- Bluetooth is available on all three models, but it is hit and miss. I managed to get one keyboard (out of four) to work, and I haven't had any success with networking or audio devices. 
- Hotsync was a pain to set up, but works well now that it is configured. 
- Most of the best software is *very* hard to find. I frequently had to resort to delving deep in to the wayback machine.

## The Ugly
