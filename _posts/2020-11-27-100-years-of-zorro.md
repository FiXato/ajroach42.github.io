title: '100 Years of Zorro! '
---
The silent film The Mark of Zorro was released 100 years ago today. Last year I did [a review of The Mark of Zorro (1920)](http://ajroach42.com/silent-cinema-the-mark-of-zorro-1920/), and in that review I commented that if we could find a good HD transfer, it would be a perfect candidate to deOldify. I haven't found an  HD copy yet, but I did find a nice sharp DVD transfer that I kicked off for DeOldification this morning. 

We'll see how that goes tonight or tomorrow! 

In the meantime, you can watch the original black and white version here:
