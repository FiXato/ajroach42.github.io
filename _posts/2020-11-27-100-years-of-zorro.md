title: '100 Years of Zorro! '
---
The silent film The Mark of Zorro was released 100 years ago today. Last year I did [a review of The Mark of Zorro (1920)](http://ajroach42.com/silent-cinema-the-mark-of-zorro-1920/), and in that review I commented that if we could find a good HD transfer, it would be a perfect candidate to deOldify. I haven't found an  HD copy yet, but I did find a nice sharp DVD transfer that I kicked off for [DeOldification](http://ajroach42.com/further-experiments-with-deoldify/) this morning. 

The results are honestly pretty good! 

A lot of early silent films don't colorize well. I think this because DeOldify gets confused about the fact that the whole image is in focus, the weird depth of field confuses the algo. 

But this one mostly looks great. 

Enjoy!
