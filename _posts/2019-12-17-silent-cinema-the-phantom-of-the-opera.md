title: Silent Cinema - The Phantom of the Opera

I couldn't sleep Sunday night, so I watched The Phantom of the Opera and ended up on a deep dive in to the history of the film, and it's place in old Hollywood lore. What follows are links to watch both major versions of the movie, a discussion of the history and preservation status of the print, a brief synopsis, and a small review. Dig in, this is a fun one. 


## What's it about? 

__CW: Spoilers for a 95 year old movie that you already know the plot of even if you think you don't. Mentions of abuse against women__ 

The movie is about an old, frightening man who attempts to use his influence to groom and assualt a young performer, because Paris at the turn of the century and Hollywood in 2020 are the same in more ways than we want to consider. 

In the movie, the man is an urban legend, a spectre hanging over the head of the Paris Opera House, a ghost. He attempts to bully and frighten other performers away from the spotlight to secure a leading role for his target. He lavishes her with praise, he "gives" her the starring role, he attempts to isolate her from her friends and family, and eventually he assaults her. In this version, he pays for his crimes. Not every version of this story ends so well.  

It's not a new story. It is a scary story, and it makes for a good movie. 

## Versions (part 1) 

There's a lot to say about the various versions of this film, but I'll start with a really simple statement: The most significant part of The Phantom of the Opera is it's use of color. 

There are two main versions available today, one is (most of) the original 1925 print, but in black and white, and with some heavy damage. The other is a print from 1929, the origins of which are unknown. The '29 print is cleaner, and most versions of the '29 print in circulation include the original color sequences and approximate the original tinting. 

We'll call the '29 print the Eastman print, because that's what it is. We'll call the other print the 16mm print, because that's what it is.

Watch the Eastman print. Watch it with any commercial soundtrack. [This version is as good as any](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/8b1ada89-b0e1-4bd3-9c2d-3695193f65b2). After you've watched it, if you're hooked and want to learn more, then you can reach for [the 16mm print](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/32391a28-1ee9-4a90-aabe-4c74107baf30).
