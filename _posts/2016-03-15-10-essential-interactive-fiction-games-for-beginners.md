title: 10 Essential Interactive Fiction Games for Beginners
---

Interactive Fiction Games are a subset of the larger genre of [text adventure games](http://ajroach42.github.io/text-adventures-for-casual-gamers-infocom-inform-tads/), distinguished by their high quality prose, plot development, and branching story lines. I have [long been of the opinion](http://analogrevolution.com/hitchhikers-guide-galaxy-30th-anniversary-game/) that Text Adventure games took their first stumbling steps towards Interactive Fiction starting with Douglas Adams excellent Hitchhiker's Guid to the Galaxy. 

Unfortunately, The Hitchhiker's Game is increadibly difficult and can be outright hostile towards inexperienced players. (One puzzle, that appears early in the game, was so notoriously difficult that Infocom sold T-Shirts, so that you could brag about solving it.) Much of the Interactive Fiction of the 80s depended on the players already having more than a pasive familiarity with the conventions of Text Adventures in general. It was far more recently that we began developing IF games that were actually approachable by new players. 

Thankfully, I stumbled across some truly great Interactive Fiction and Text Adventure games on a freeware collection purchased for a song from a long forgotten toy store when I was younger. This experience inspired a lifelong love of the format, and I'm always working to introduce new folks to it. 

Here are 10 Essential Interactive Fiction Games for Beginners: 

## The 80s

[The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy](http://iplayif.com/?story=http://labs.toolness.com/parchment/infocom/hitchhik.z5

## More Fiction than Game:

## More Game than Fiction

[Lost Pig](http://iplayif.com/?story=http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/LostPig.z8)

One of my personal favorites, Lost Pig. In this game, you play a troll in search of a pig. Lost Pig is a very funny, well written, and challenging game. It is fair, has a good hint system, and has a much larger plot, and much richer characterization than it might initially appear.
