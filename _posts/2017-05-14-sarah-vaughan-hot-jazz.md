Today, I found myself rather unexpectedly at one of the several excellent record stores around DC. While I was there, I picked up an Excellent EP from Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Max Roach. It was originally recorded way back in 1944, and it's amazing.

The EP was ultimately released in 1953, and features Vaughan right at the start of her career. It was recorded at a scant few weeks after the end of [the Musicians strike of 42-44.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942%E2%80%9344_musicians%27_strike), making this one of the only recordings of Parker, Gillespie, and Vaghan from that period.

It was released on the budget label "Remmington" which is fairly notorious for low quality pressings of poorly recorded classical music, with high levels of surface noise. Thankfully, this record dodged that bullet. It certainly sounds like it was recorded in 1944, and there is some muddiness to the sound that would not be present if it had been recorded closer to it's release, but it doesn't detract from the liveliness of these performances, or the historical significance of the recording. 

On the whole, this is one of the most exciting records I've picked up in a Long time, and I'm beyond excited to spin it a few dozen times in the next week or two.
