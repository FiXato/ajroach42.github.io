It came out a while ago, and it's probably the album I listen to the most in quiet moments. (Well, that, and [L'Amour](http://ajroach42.github.io/l-amour-lewis-forgotten-soft-synth-mumblepop/)) 

I met the owner of Human Sounds Records, Joshua, when he was just getting started, and was still dubbing all his tapes by hand. He's such a cool dude, and he's put together some truly astounding music. [Go check all of it out.](https://humansoundsrecords.bandcamp.com/)
