title: How to Fix New Content Discovery
---

First, let's introduce the problem in terms that really drive it home: Every hour, more than [2 years of video](http://www.tubefilter.com/2014/12/01/youtube-300-hours-video-per-minute/) content is added to youtube. If you were to start watching right now, and didn't take a break to sleep for the next 2 years, you'd be able to watch all the videos that had been uploaded in the last hour. Obviously this is more content than could reasonably be proccessed in any meaningful way, and there will be two more years worth in an hour. How is anything new supposed to get discovered in that overwhelming miasma of, mostly, crap? 

To a greater or lesser extent, the same thing is a problem across all media platforms. Twitter has too much noise, Bandcamp and Soundcloud already have more than a lifetime's worth of music (with more added each day), and the problem is getting worse. It's easier than ever to create things. It's easier than ever to share them. It's impossible, as a result, to get noticed. 

You might think I'm exagerating, but [people who make their living on Youtube](https://medium.com/@hankgreen/you-cant-make-it-on-youtube-anymore-10977c194a4f) agree. The problems run deeper than that, even because the people who already have our attention also strugle to keep it, and it's difficult for us to find out about even things that are important to us, unless they are well marketed. 

And that's the real takeaway here, if you want to get noticed today you need the support of someone who has already been noticed (and how are you going to get them to notice you?) or you need to be well marketed, well funded (and, even still, fairly lucky.) With everyone in the world competing in the same marketplace, for the same people, the distribution of wealth (in terms of attention at least) is becoming rapidly more concentrated in to the hands of a small few. 

See, it's [US economics post WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion). The birth of the internet was WWII for media, massively redistributing attention. Now we've entered an attenion bubble. Everyone is siloed away in to an echo chamber that serves up what they are already comfortable with, and what the algorithms decide is enough of the same to keep them comfortable. 

We discover nothing new. We march endlessly towards one, boring, massive monoculture where everyone listens to the same music, watches the same shows, and drives the same cars. 

But it doesn't have to be this way. We can fix this, and it doesn't even have to be very hard. See, the problem is scale. There's just too much stuff, and it's too easy to look at that and go for the stuff that your friends already vouched for, that the celebrity you like just endorsed, that the algorithm fed you. So reduce the clutter. 

There are dozens of ways to do it. New social networks pop up all the time, and every once in a while one of them will catch on for long enough to be the perfect place to find some of the interesting, weird, and wonderful things that are being created. Then growth happens, because this is the place to find the cool new stuff, and monitization tactics creep in, and suddenly your surrounded by listicles again. 

Some networks have tried to limit some aspect of their service, so that growth doesn't make the service useless. Vine only shows you 6 seconds of content at a time. Tumblr only shows you the things that have been shared by the people you're following, which means that it can actually work well if you're following worthwhile people (but how do you find them?). Twitter imposed a character limit, and (at least originally) did no algorithmic curration. 

Eventually, all of these artificial limitations run in to the same problems of scale that have plagued every large digital project. They're interesting experiments. They get a lot of things right. They don't solve the problem in any meaningful way. 

I think that there is another alternative.
