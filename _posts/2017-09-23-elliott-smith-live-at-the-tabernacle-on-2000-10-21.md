His live performances tend to be a different kind of animal from the lo-fi Beatles productions he put together on his studio albums. It's not fair to say that his live perfomrances are less lavish, some of them (this one included) pull out all the stops, but they certainly lose a bit of the dreamlike, haunting ambiance that follows from his studio output.

That is to say, Elliot Smith in a live performance feels more real and concrete than Elliot Smith in the studio. The performance quality here is top notch, and for an audience recording, so is the audio quality. I wish whoever taped this show would tape some more!
