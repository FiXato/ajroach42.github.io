title: A Game of Penny Dreadfuls
---


Recently, I've been chipping away (slowly, but steadily) at an idea for a tabletop game that has taken root in my brain. Over a period of two weeks, I took the game from an idea that wouldn't leave me alone, through to a complete rulebook and a set of generic 3D printed models. Since receiving my first batch of 3D prints, I have overseen just over a dozen playthroughs, and I'm currently working to improve the game's balance and increase startup speed. 


The finished game will be called __A Game of Penny Dreadfuls__ and will initially feature characters drawn from victorian popular fiction. Eventually, the game will expand to include other horror, crime, and pulp characters through the 1920s. 

The game is a fairly straightforward tabletop strategy game, that is played on a hexagonal grid, using small figures. The goal is to have a leaner, more simplified format than many other tabletop strategy games, without reducing the challenges presented, or the potential for finesse. I'm super excited to see this game coming to light, and I can't wait to get other folks playing it.
