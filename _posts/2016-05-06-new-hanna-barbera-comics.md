While picking up a copy of the [Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency comic](http://amzn.to/23uPSNK) I noticed this absolutely fantastic poster for an upcoming DC comic featuring characters from Hanna Barbera. I'm excited to see what they do with this. [Pictured Here: The Herculoids, The Impossibles, Frankenstien Jr, Birdman, Space Ghost (and company), The Galaxy Trio, Johny Quest, and the Mighty Mightor]

Here are some other promotional images that have been released.

Normally, I avoid reboots. But look at that! The image of Jonny and Hadji confronting Space Ghost is especially well crafted. 

Here's hoping they do something cool with it all.
