It's been a slow few weeks around these parts, at least publically. That's because I'm working on a lot of things behind the scenes. We're getting ready to roll out a new Podcast magazine from Analog Revolution, I'm working on a crowd sourced Sci-fi podcast series, and a bunch of other stuff! 

Don't worry, though, I have some neat articles planned for the coming weeks. Stay tuned, for sure.
