title: Gaming like it's 1923
---
Everyone's favorite independent game site, [itch.io](https://itch.io), is celebrating [Public Domain Day](https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/) with a [public domain remix game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1923), and that sounds like the best idea I've heard this year.![1923_montage.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/1923_montage.jpg)


From their anouncement post: 

> 2019 is the first year that new content is entering the public domain since 1998. Works published in 1923 are now free to share and remix. This game jam is to celebrate these works entering the commons by making games about and inspired by them.

I'm going to try to contribute something small, and I'll post more about it here as I settle on exactly what that will be.
