I have been on something of a vintage science fiction kick recently. What better way to celibrate that than with a restored, color print of Georges Melies 1902 opus, A Trip to the Moon.

Yes, it is from 1902, making it 105 years old. Yes, the fragments of color you see in the above video are original. They were hand painted on to the film before it was screened. (The color effect is most impressive in the later scenes.)
