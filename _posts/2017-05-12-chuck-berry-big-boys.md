At 90 years old, just before he passed away, Chuck Berry recorded an album of all new material. It's due to come out next month. The [first single is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Zoh-apWRE), and it's everything you'd want from a 90 year old rock legend.

The guitar blisters and writhes as if Berry was still back in 1957, changing the face of modern music. The man was a lot of things, and many of them were not good, but I'm glad to have new music from him.
