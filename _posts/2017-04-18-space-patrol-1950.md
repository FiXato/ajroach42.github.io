title: Space Patrol (1950)
---
The name _Space Patrol_ has been used by more than a few series over the years. Earlier, I wrote about [Space Patrol Orion](http://ajroach42.github.io/space-patrol-orion-the-other-groundbreaking-scifi-series-from-1966/), which is an awesome show and worth paying attention to. But it isn't my favorite show to carry the Space Patrol monkier. That honor belongs to the original Space Patrol from 1950. 

That's right, 1950. It predates I Love Lucy. It predates pretty much every TV show you've ever heard of. There are a few reasons for this:

- TV was still a very niche medium, even in 1950. 
- Videotape, for archiving TV programs, wouldn't be invented for a few more years. (Leaving us to rely on low-quality//expensive Telecines) 
- We are Shitty stewards of history.
