title: 'The Last Jedi, Rebellion, and Masculinity'
---
I've been putting off writing this post for a long time, because I don't want to deal with the replies I will inevitably get from a very specific kind of cranky, usually white, usually masculine, usually Gen X or early millenial nerd. But not writing something because other people are insufferably shitty is a bad way to live, so let's talk about how The Last Jedi was a revolutionary, significant, and important entry in the Star Wars cannon. Ready? 

I'm not going to summarize the events of the film. You have [wikipedia for that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi). Instead, I'm going to focus on the ways that this film served as a response to, a critique, and ultimately a rejection of every Star Wars film that came before it (this is good!) and also as an endorsement of some of the worst facests of neoliberal politics. Yep, we're going there. If that doesn't sound like the kind of thing you want to take part in, rather than making yourself miserable, [consider reading this instead](http://ajroach42.com/diy-media/). 

The film, as you may remember, opens with everyone's favorite rebel Poe ignoring orders to the contrary and leading a dangerous, and costly assault against the forces of the first order. People die. Lots of people die. Poe's attack is successful, but it comes at a high cost. This is the first time, of many, that The Last Jedi demonstrates to us that individual heroics are risky and dangerous. 

Poe ignored his orders, and people died. Poe ignored his orders, completed a worthwhile objective, and left his team less well equipped to deal with the next problem. Poe saved a tree at the expense of the forest, and The Last Jedi went to great pains to demonstrate to us how much damage this wreckless behavior caused. Contrast that with the action in all of the original Star Wars films, in which risky, heroic, individual, and strikingly Masculine, action was the only answer to the oppresive violence of the state. 

From there, the action progresses. Poe's decision has further consequences. He is punished, demoted. His choices leave the resistance forces poorly equipped to handle the next assualt. How does Poe respond? By taking matters in to his hands, of course. By ignoring direct orders, refusing to communicate with his leaders, and launching in to another foolhardy plan.
