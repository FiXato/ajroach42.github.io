This blog is a new thing for me (as you can see, this is only the fourth post) that I'm building and maintaining as a learning exercise, and a way to keep my skillset sharp. 

The site is built with Jekyll and hosted through Github pages. For those unfamiliar with either of these things, that means: 

 - The site is static (and should be pretty damn fast.) 
 - The posts are written in markdown
	 - which gives me an opportunity to really familiarize myself with markdown in a way that I have been unable to previously.
 - The heavy lifting for the site is done through Github pages. 
	 - This means that I get to re-familiarize myself with GIT, and to work with Github. 
	 - That's great experience for me, and a good way to keep my skill set sharp when I'm not actively working on any open source projects. 
 - The site is based on templates (like wordpress or another CMS) but loads without all the overhead of a dynamically generated site.
	 - That means that, over time, I'll be able to do some pretty nifty things as I explore the template system and conform it to my needs. 
 - Writing regularly lets me keep up with my ongoing projects, and have a single place to direct people when they want more information. 


So, that's the gist of my goals with running this blog. It's a place for me to keep track of the things I'm building and the thoughts that led me to build those things, and to maintain certain facets of my skillset.
