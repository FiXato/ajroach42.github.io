title: Announcing Space Age Radio!
---
Space Age Radio is a new audio podcast from Analog Revolution. I [mentioned yesterday](http://ajroach42.com/announcing-space-age-tv/) that it was coming soon, and it has! You can [listen online](http://analogrevolution.com/series/space-age-radio/) or [Subscribe](http://analogrevolution.com/feed/podcast/space-age-radio/). 

This is a weekly series, that cycles through episodes of various Space Age radio programs, including 'Tom Corbett, Space Cadet' and Space Patrol, among others. New episodes launch every Thursday! Unlike with Space Age TV, most of these radio series are complete, or close to it. Most of the episodes are available in high quality, and they are more adventureous and ambitious than the TV episodes featuring the same characters. 

These were also live broadcasts, and for shows that aired on Radio and TV, the Radio version almost always features the same cast. Inasmuch as these early scifi shows can be considered to have a 'canon', the radio episodes can be considered first class citizens in that canon. 

I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions, or you'd like to make a request, you know how to reach me!
