I recently had cause to get some 3D printing done. After getting a quote from Shapeways (DAMN!) I turned to 3D hubs, and found local folks who have gone above and beyond in the service of my project. 

The service is pretty simple. 3D hubs integrates with Shapeways online repository of 3D printable images, and helps you find someone in your community who can assist in printing your items. It's fast, it's cheap, and it's generally awesome. 

Two hubs, in particular, have done an absolutely excellent job with the work I've given them so far. [CB designs](https://www.3dhubs.com/atlanta/hubs/cb-designs) and [Northwest 3D](https://www.3dhubs.com/atlanta/hubs/northwest-3d). Both have really gone above and beyond to help bring my (rather complicated) project to life. 

This isn't a paid endorsement. I don't get anything out of it. I've just had a positive experience, and I wanted to share.
