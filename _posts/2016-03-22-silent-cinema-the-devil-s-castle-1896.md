Today, for Silent Cinema, we feature an 1896 short film by Georges Méliès featuring a new score by [Kai Engel](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/Chapter_Two__Mild/Kai_Engel_-_Chapter_Two_-_Mild_-_01_Floret). The Devil's Castle (also called The Haunted Castle) is, in one stroke, the first Vampire film, the first Horror film, a comedy, and one of the longest films produced up to this point. It clocks in just over 3 minutes, and it's exactly what you want to watch.
