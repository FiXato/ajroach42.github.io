Become Grunk, a troll in search of a lost pig, in this great little piece of Interactive Fiction. <iframe src="http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FLostPig.z8"></iframe> 

I'm a huge fan of modern Interactive Fiction, and I love it's cheesy roots. This story does a great job of melding the two in to something worth playing. 

10/10 - Worth your time.
