title: Listen Like it's 1949
---
A few weeks ago, I put 5000 tracks From [Archive.org's great 78 project](https://great78.archive.org/) up on my server at [Of Many Trades, available via Gopher](http://ofmanytrades.com:70/Music/78s). Now it's also available as an [internet radio station](http://radio.ofmanytrades.com).  

This is an endless shuffle through the 5000+ tracks currently available. You can listen to it directly in your browser, or open it from VLC or another media player to see metadata (including artist and track titles.) 

And, of course, if you hear anything you like, they're all available for download via gopher.
