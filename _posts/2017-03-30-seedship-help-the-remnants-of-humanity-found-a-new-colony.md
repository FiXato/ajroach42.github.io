I have spent a large portion of the last two days playing [Seedship](http://philome.la/johnayliff/seedship/play) by Scifi author John Ayliff. In this game, you play as the AI of a spaceship, with the last 1000 humans onboard, charged with ferrying them through the void, and ensuring that they are able to thrive. It's a generative, text based game, and it's super engrossing.

I really love the game, and I think it's well worth playing over and over again.
