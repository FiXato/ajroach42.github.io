title: 'Actual Nazi Steve Rogers '

With this morning's news about BREXIT, and the ever forward march of racist nationalism, I decided it was time to talk about Captain America. Steve Rogers, the man most people know as Captain America, is a HYDRA Agent/Nazi. This is now part of the official marvel cannon. As you can imagine, this has made a lot of people angry, and has widley been regarded as a bad move. There's more to this story than you might have realized, though. Sure, it's about the control of modern mythology, the massive ammount of power weileded by copyright holders, or the unforgivable racism exhbited by a lot of Marvel fans. But there's more to it than that. Come explore with me. 

First, some background: Steve Rogers is a comic book character created by Marvel in the 40s. He has traditionally fought evil as Captain America. Sometimes that evil comes in the form of HYDRA, a group composed of former Nazi leaders. He was written by two Jewish men, partially to whip up support for the US entering WWII. He's supposed to represent everything that is good about America. 

Recently, Steve Rogers was unable to act as Captain America. This prompted Sam Willson, AKA Falcon, to take up the mantle. Sam Willson is black. This caused many, many racists to absolutely lose their collective shit. Sam Willson is still staring in his own series of Captain America stories, and he represents a continuation of the spirit of the Original character. 

In response the the giant, racist backlash against the decision to make Captain America a young black man instead of an unfrozen 80 year old, Marvel and the current Author of Captain America got together and decided to bring Steve Rogers back. They brought him back as a secret HYDRA agent. Captain America: Secret Nazi. Essentially, the hero that these racists deserved. It's almost a delicious commentary on the kind of people who would get upset that Captain America's shield was being carried by a black man. Almost, but not quite. 

See, Captain America is a modern American folk hero. He exists in the kind of cultural commons that were once occupied by the likes of Paul Bunyon, Robin Hood, or even the greek Pantheon. Traditionally, these heros would exist in multiple, competing, mutually exclusive stories. Each told by a new party. All of them coming together to form something akin to a Cannon. Heck, even The Bible followed this model, until the Council of Nicia convened to decide what was "officially" the bible, and what wasn't. 

Well, Marvel's copyright on the Captain America character turns them in to the modern equivelent of the Council of Nicia, and they've just decided that Steve Rogers is officially a Nazi. If this had been a non-cannon mini-series, no one would bat an eye. If this had been one of many competing depictions of Steve Rogers, specifically designed to criticize the biggest biggots among his fans, I'd applaud it. But that's not the case. Officially, now, Steve Rogers is a Nazi. No one but Marvel can do anything about it. 

And, let's face it, it's a comic book. Nothing is permanent, but this will always be a part of the character's history moving forward. 

Let's sum up: 

- Steve Rogers, that character created specifically to fight against Nazis, is now a Nazi. 
- Marvel's copyright and trademark on the character mean that no competing, non-nazi version of the character can exist. 
- Marvel made Steve a Nazi to prove a valuable point, but did it in such a way that it hurts as much as it helps. 

There's a fun little twist in all of this, though. Captain America is a rip off of an earlier character that has since fallen in to the Public Domain. 

The original character was called The Shield. He wore a Red White and Blue jump suit, carried an unbreakable shield. I can't make this stuff up, just look: 








Even Captain America has an apperance that has fallen in to the Public Domain. This time, he was a gun wielding District Attourney/Vigilanty named Grant Gardner,  working to bring down crime at home, in a Republic film serial. 

So, while we can't do anything about Actual Nazi Steve Rogers, there's a lot we can do about the fact that many (most?) of America's modern folk heros are controlled by ageless corporate behemoths. 

I'd love to see a comic where The Shield has to fight Grant Gardner, after he veres too far in to nationalism.
