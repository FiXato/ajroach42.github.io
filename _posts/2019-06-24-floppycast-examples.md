title: Floppycast examples
---
In my [previous post](http://ajroach42.com/floppycasts-1-44mb-podcasts/) I talked about very low bitrate audio. I promised some examples. This post is examples. The examples are the first minute and change of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio show, because that's what I had on hand. The two clips are the same length, and are presented in the absolute worst quality I was able to produce. 

Opus has a little less file overhead, resulting in a file that is 77kb, vs 102KB for MP3. For reference, the entire 29.8 minute episode is 1,671 KB for the Mp3 version and 1,289 KB for the Opus version using the same settings.
